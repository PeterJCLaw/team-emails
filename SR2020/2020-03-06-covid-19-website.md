# COVID-19 Coronavirus Student Robotics Updates

Hello again,

Following on from an email sent yesterday, we have now put a page on our website expanding further on how we're assessing the situation regarding COVID-19.

You can find it here: https://studentrobotics.org/news/2020-03-11-sr2020-covid-19-updates/

We will be keeping this page up to date as things progress. Should the event be cancelled, we will of course let you know immediately.

If you or your school has any questions about our handling of the event, please don't hesitate to contact us at teams@studentrobotics.org.
