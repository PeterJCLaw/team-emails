Hi all!

Kickstart is only just around the corner, so it's time to confirm details for the kickstart events happening this year.

As stated in a previous email, we're running 3 kickstart events this year:

- [The University of Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/southampton-kickstart/)
- [The University of Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/cambridge-kickstart/)
- [The offices of Thread, Whitechapel](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/london-kickstart/)

These event pages are constantly being updated with more information, so be sure to keep an eye out!

You all requested a specific kickstart event when you signed up for the year. We've not had to rearrange things so far, so you've all got places at those venues! If you wish to change venue, or cannot attend kickstart, please let us know, so we can make the appropriate arrangements with your kit.

Which kickstart we're expecting you at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1plZqwcO0WIdoWhiUNdGxy-6uLSoH8vIsFdKzwHXtf0c/edit?usp=sharing

For those who cannot attend kickstart, we will send instructions over shortly after kickstart around how to receive your kits.

We're hoping you live-stream the Southampton kickstart presentation, and will be releasing the rules document to [the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/) during the event, so please keep an eye out if you cannot attend in person!

If you have any questions, please let us know as soon as possible!

We look forward to seeing you all there!
