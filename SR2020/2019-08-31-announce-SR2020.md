Hi,

We're pleased to announce that registration for Student Robotics 2020 is now
open. If you would like to compete, please complete this [application form][signup-form]
with the details of your team. All future emails about SR2020 will be sent there.

This year we're hosting three Kickstart events, all on **TODO DATE**:

 * at Thread's offices in London
 * at the University of Southampton
 * in Cambridge

We're expecting to run with a similar number of teams to SR2019, so we're sure
that places will go fast. We expect to confirm places at the end of September,
so sign up now!

  [I'd like to bring a team to SR2020][signup-form]

We look forward to seeing your teams,

Student Robotics
