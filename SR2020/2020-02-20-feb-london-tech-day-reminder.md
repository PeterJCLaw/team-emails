Hi teams,

Just a reminder and some information on [the tech day we're running][london-tech-day] on Saturday the 29th February at the offices of Thread.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They’re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We will provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as
well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with
your robots. You will however need to bring your own laptops to work off.

We will have some of the actual token boxes for you to test against too.

If you’d like to attend, please **[sign up for the London Tech Day][tech-day-signup]** as soon as possible.

We’ll also be hosting a [Tech Day in Southampton on the 7th March][soton-tech-day],
though this will only take place if we have sufficient interest. If you’d like to
attend, please **[sign up for the Southampton Tech Day][tech-day-signup]** by
Wednesday 4th March.
