Hi teams,

Just a reminder and some information on [the tech day we're running][soton-tech-day] on Saturday the 8th February at Southampton University.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They’re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We will provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as
well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with
your robots.

If you’d like to attend, please **[sign up for the Southampton Tech Day][tech-day-signup]**.

We’ll also be hosting a [Tech Day in London on the 29th February][london-tech-day-feb],
though this will only take place if we have sufficient interest. If you’d like to
attend, please **[sign up for the London Tech Day][tech-day-signup]** by
Wednesday 26th February.
