Hello there!

If you're reading this, it's because you were unable to attend kickstart.

As you're likely aware, our kickstart event has now happened, and the game for SR2020 has been announced: [Two Colours](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/)

## Kit Disclaimer

Before we can dispatch your kit, we need you to sign a Kit Disclaimer form, attached to this email. Please read it, print it, sign it, and [send it back to us](mailto:teams@studentrobotics.org).

## Address confirmation

We need an explicit confirmation of the address to send the kit to, to ensure it gets sent to the right place.

Once we've got the required information, we'll get your kit dispatched, and let you know once it's on its way.
