Hi,

### Dates

We're pleased to announce the dates for the virtual competition. As previously
announced the competition will run over three weekends in July.

Teams will be able to submit their code in advance and the simulated matches
will be broadcast live via a live stream over the weekend.

Weekend         | Matches
----------------|---------
11th July 2020  | League
18th July 2020  | League
25th July 2020  | Knockout

We'll be publishing more details of the competition, including how code
submission will work and exactly when live streams will be live nearer the time.


### Celebrating your robots

We would also like to celebrate the progress made towards your physical robots
prior to the transition to a virtual competition. We appreciate that many teams
will not have had access to their robots during the lock-down, so will not be
awarding prizes for this, however we would still like to recognise the effort
which the teams had put in.

We would like to hear from you if your team has any designs, photos or video of
your physical robots which you would like to share for inclusion in the live
stream broadcast.

We are also interested in recording remote interviews with team members
regarding their robots (physical or virtual), also for inclusion in the live
stream. Participation in these interviews would require submission of a media
consent form.

If you would like to submit any robot designs, photos or video, or are would
like to be interviewed for the live stream, please email us at <teams@>.


We look forward to seeing your robots (of all kinds).

_The SR Team_
