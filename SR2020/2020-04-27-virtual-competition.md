Hi teams,

We are working hard on a solution for the virtual competion. Our aim is to release a development environment for teams soon, then run a **test event around late May / early June**, with further rounds in the following weeks.

To help us gauge your interest, please fill in our [quick poll](https://forms.gle/gE6o4XyzjzJoAWHB9) on how likely your team will be to compete.

As we said in the previous email, we aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible so teams can use the code they have been working on since Kickstart.

For more information, please read our [latest news post](https://www.studentrobotics.org/news/2020-04-16-sr2020-virtual-competition-announcement/), and you can always find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/).

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](teams@studentrobotics.org)!
