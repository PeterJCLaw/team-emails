Hello all,

Following guidance from the UK government and the University of Reading, we will need to postpone Student Robotics 2020 from the original date in April, until some time late June / early July.

## Competition

We are currently investigating the following dates for the competition:

- 27th - 28th June
- 4th - 5th July
- 11th - 12th July

Please fill in the following poll to let us know your preferred dates: https://forms.gle/21x6F5EBMAtu6GKh9

The event will still take place over a weekend, at the University of Reading.

We hope to confirm the updated date in the next week, so please let us know as soon as you can.

## Tech Days

There are no current planned tech days. Once things have settled down, we can organise some.

The [forum][forum] is still a great place to get help from blueshirts and other teams, in addition to showing off your progress!

If you are looking for more in-depth support from blueshirts, you can email us at teams@studentrobotics.org to request remote mentoring.


If you have any further questions, please let us know on teams@studentrobotics.org.
