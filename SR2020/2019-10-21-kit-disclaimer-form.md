Hi all,

Kickstart is less than a week away, and we're putting the finishing touches to kickstart. If you're attending a kickstart event, your kits are ready and waiting at the venue. For those who can't attend kickstart, we're currently working out the details for how to ship you your kit.

Before we can issue a kit, you must sign a kit disclaimer form. Historically these have been signed at the event, but to speed things up, we're sending them over early, so you can get your kit quicker!

Attached to this email is the disclaimer form. Please read it, print it, sign it, and [send it back to us](mailto:teams@studentrobotics.org). Alternatively, feel free to sign it and bring it with you. We will of course have some spares at the event to sign on the day.

Please only attend the kickstart we're expecting you at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1plZqwcO0WIdoWhiUNdGxy-6uLSoH8vIsFdKzwHXtf0c/edit?usp=sharing. If you can no longer attend, please let us know!

If you have any questions, please let us know as soon as possible!

We look forward to seeing you all there!
