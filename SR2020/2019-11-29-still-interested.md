Hello!

Our records show that, other than an interest in taking part, we haven't heard anything from you this competition cycle. If you're still interested please reply to this email by the 31st January, with a signed kit disclaimer form and a shipping address we can send the kit to. If you don't respond we'll be forced to allocate your kit to another team.

Hope to hear from you,

The SR team
