Hi all,

In light of everything happening, and the uncertainty it brings, we're unfortunately cancelling the in-person competition for Student Robotics 2020.

## Virtual Competition

The virtual competition event will take place over a few weekends in July, with a few weekends of league matches, and a knockout final.

As we said in the previous email, we aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible so teams can use the code they have been working on since Kickstart.

The [forum](https://studentrobotics.org/forum/) will be open and staffed should you need help from us blueshirts.

We will be announcing the final details of the virtual competition early next week.

For more information, please read our [latest news post](), and you can always find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/).

## Kits

With regards to kits, please keep a hold of them for the time being. Further information on what to do with them will be announced in the next few months.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](teams@studentrobotics.org)!
