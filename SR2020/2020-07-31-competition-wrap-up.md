Hi all,

First off, we'd like to thank you for taking part in Student Robotics 2020 and making it such a successful event! We were blown away by how well the teams adapted to the virtual competition in these uncertain times. An article about the competition, results, and game has been [posted on our website](https://studentrobotics.org/news/2020-07-25-post-competition/).

Congratulations again to our winners:
