# Update on SR and the COVID-19 Coronavirus

Hello everyone, 

I'm sure you've heard about the COVID-19 coronavirus, and about many large events being cancelled due to concerns of spreading the virus.

We're keeping a keen eye on the situation, and will be following the advice of the [UK Department of Health and Social Care][uk-coronavirus-page]. Considering this is an event for minors, we will be taking decisions with an abundance of caution.

The competition is still several weeks away and our plans will adapt to suit the situation as things develop. We'll also be briefing all volunteers and attendees about best hygiene practices, and ensuring they're followed throughout the competition.

We expect all teams who are attending the competition to follow the [guidelines][phe-guidelines] on COVID-19 from Public Health England.

If you or your school has any questions about our handling of the event, please don't hesitate to contact us at teams@studentrobotics.org.
