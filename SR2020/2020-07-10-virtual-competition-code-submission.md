Hi

You can now submit your robot code through our website for the virtual competition.

[Submit your robot](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/)

For each league session, you have until 10am that day to submit your team's latest code.

Simply log in with your SR details (the same as the IDE and forum) then select and upload a .zip of your code.
(Make sure your .zip contains a file named `robot.py`)

You can see your team's previous uploads on that same page.

Good luck!
