Hello There!

Our records show you've not been especially active on the IDE recently, and we want to offer our support!

## Assistance

If you're struggling with your robot, here's a few resources which might help you out:

- [The Docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/)
- [The Forum](https://studentrobotics.org/forum/), to get help from other teams / blue shirts
- [Our Twitter](https://twitter.com/studentrobotics), where you can see what other teams are up to

## Mentors

Alternatively, if you'd prefer some more hands-on support, let us know and we may be able to allocate you a mentor.

Your mentor will help guide your team towards good solutions for their robot,
provide assistance where they might need it as well as help them understand the
kit, the rules and the competition as a whole.

Mentors are volunteers who have typically competed or helped out with the
competition before. They’re able to give help on all aspects of building and
programming your robot, and if they don’t know something, they typically know
someone who does.

Mentors will mostly attend in person, though for some teams we may not have
anyone nearby. In those cases we may be able to offer remote mentoring (by video
call).

## Tech Days

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They’re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

You can see the list of upcoming tec days on [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/).

## Unable to continue?

If you no longer wish to, or are unable to compete in Student Robotics 2020, please let us know as soon as possible.

If you have any further questions, please let us know!
