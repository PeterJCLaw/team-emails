Hello!

Unfortunately, We are currently facing delays getting your kit shipped out to you. An issue exists around ensuring the batteries adhere to new legislation around transporting dangerous good (of which our batteries are).

Please be assured we're actively working on this, and will let you know as there's an update. We will be steps to ensure this delay doesn't happen in future.

Thank you for your patience.
