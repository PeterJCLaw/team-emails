Hello!

We’re eager to go ahead with the 2020 competition as planned. The only things that will stop us are:

- If the government bans gatherings like ours.
- If the venue can’t host us any more.
- If we aren’t confident that enough teams will actually attend.

With that in mind, we'd like to confirm the opinions of teams, to ensure we make the correct, most informed, decision.

Could you fill out the below, 2 question survey around your schools stance on competing: https://forms.gle/zsMRX5czunKdt5GU8

If you or your school has any questions about our handling of the event, please don't hesitate to contact us at teams@studentrobotics.org.
