Hello!

Weâ€™re eager to go ahead with the 2020 competition as planned. The only things that will stop us are:

- If the government says we can't/shouldn't proceed
- If the venue cancels our booking
- If we can't get enough teams to come
- If we can't get enough volunteers to come
- We don't think we can offer a safe event

With that in mind, we'd like to confirm the opinions of teams, to ensure we make the correct, most informed, decision.

Could you please fill out the below, 2 question survey around your school's stance on competing: https://forms.gle/zsMRX5czunKdt5GU8

If you or your school has any questions about our handling of the event, please don't hesitate to contact us at teams@studentrobotics.org.
