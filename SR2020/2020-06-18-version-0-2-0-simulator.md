subject: Virtual Competition Simulation Version 2 Released
---

Hi

We have released version 0.2.0 of the competition simulation which you can download from the [Docs page](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/competition-simulator/).

The following changes have been made:

- Reducing the range of randomness which can be exhibited by motors and sensors
- Adding multiple robots to the arena with the abilitiy to assign distict code files to each
- Fix the gripper jumping open bug
- Add a sleep method which runs on "simulation time" instead of actual time. This is useful for computers where the simulation runs slowly
- Colour robots and scoring zones
- Fix the warnings which appear in the console when the simulation is first loaded
- Switch gold and silver token indexing to match the rules
- Enable control of the robot LEDs

Our [forum](https://studentrobotics.org/forum/) remains open and staffed by blueshirts. We encourage teams to discuss solutions or highlight any issues they find.

Sign-up for the virtual competition is still open for those who haven't already signed up: [Sign-up form](https://forms.gle/ouuAipocwse3E4XY7)
