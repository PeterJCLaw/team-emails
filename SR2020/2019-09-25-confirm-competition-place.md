Hello there!

We're pleased to confirm your place at Student Robotics 2020! You will receive an invite shortly to the mailing list on Google Groups. This mailing list will be the source of our announcements during the competition year.

With this, we're also happy to announce the dates and locations for kickstart. Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year, where the game will be announced and robotics kits will be handed out. The event is also invaluable to competitors, allowing them to discuss ideas, and get direct input and support from our talented blue shirts.

Kickstart will be on 26th October 2019

This year, we're running 3 Kickstart events:

- The University of Southampton
- Cambridge
- Aldgate, London

When you signed up, you specified your preferred kickstart location. You've all been allocated a place at your preferred kickstart venue. If you wish to change venue, or cannot attend kickstart, please let us know as soon as possible! If you wish to just pick up your kit from a kickstart venue, please also let us know!

Detailed information for each event, including a schedule for the day, detailed locations and parking can be found on [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/).

We are currently waiting for final confirmation for the Cambridge venue, but will be publishing the specifics of that early next week.

We look forward to seeing you all there!
