Hello there!

We're pleased to confirm your place at Student Robotics 2020! You will receive an invite shortly to the mailing list on Google Groups. This mailing list will be the source of our announcements during the competition year.

With this, we're also happy to announce the dates and locations for kickstart. Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year, where the game will be announced and robotics kits will be handed out. The event is also invaluable to competitors, allowing them to discuss ideas, and get direct input and support from our talented blue shirts. We'll also be holding a series of challenges (micro games) for competitors to get to know the kit.

Kickstart will be on 26th October 2019.

This year, we're running 3 Kickstart events:

- The University of Southampton
- Cambridge
- Aldgate, London

When you signed up, you specified your preferred kickstart location. You've all been allocated a place at your preferred kickstart venue. If you wish to change venue, or cannot attend kickstart, please let us know as soon as possible! If you wish to just pick up your kit from a kickstart venue, please also let us know!

Detailed information for each event, including a schedule for the day, detailed locations and parking can be found on [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/).

Please note: We are currently waiting for final confirmation for which of our choice Cambridge venues we'll be running in, but we will confirm the specifics early next week.

We look forward to seeing you all there!
