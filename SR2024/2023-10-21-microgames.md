Hello there!

With this year's [game announced][presentation], it's time for teams to start
working on their robots. To help you get started we have a series of tasks which
will familiarise your team with their kits, called the Microgames.

## Microgames

What you'll need for the microgames:

- **Your kit**!

- At least one **computer** that can install and run the [simulator][simulator]
  software [Webots][webots] and [Python][python] (we recommend version 3.11).

- At least one **computer** which has a USB port, so you can get code onto your
  kit; it may be easier if this is the same computer that can run simulator kit.

- At least one pair of **wire cutters** and **wire strippers**, for wiring up
  your robot kit.

The microgames are available for your competitors at <https://srobo.org/microgames>.

We've prepared a [super-secret answers document][microgames-answers] just for
you supervisors to help support the competitors. We're also around in
[Discord][discord] until about 4pm to provide support so please do encourage
your team to ask questions in ‚Å†quick-questions, or your team channels. We can
also join a voice calls with your team, but you (the supervisor) do need to be
present for us to join.

The [presentation][presentation] announcing the game and the
[microgames](https://srobo.org/microgames) tasks remain available if you want to
complete these at a later date.

full details of the game and the rules for the competition is now available on
