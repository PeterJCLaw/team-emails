Hi,

We're pleased to announce the venue and date for the main competition of SR2024.

The [competition][event] will take place over the weekend of 13th and 14th April
2024 at the University of Southampton.

Over the course of the two days your robot will have lots of opportunities to
compete -- initially in the league matches and then, on Sunday afternoon, in the
knockout stage which leads up to the grand final.

This two day event is the culmination of your team's work over the prior six
months. This is reflected both in the performance of your robot as well as the
judging of the other competition awards. We're always impressed by the ingenuity
and creativeness of our teams -- from the designs of the robots to the
[theming][theming] of the teams.

As well as the main competition arena, the venue will have pit areas for each
team. This will give you the opportunity to meet the other teams taking part as
well as a place to work on your robots between matches. Just like at [Tech
Days][tech-days-101], we'll also have lots of our volunteer blueshirts on hand
to support your team.

While we aim to provide a space for you to work on your robot, we won't be able
to provide any tools. Be sure to bring with you any tools, spare materials and
other equipment that you might need.
