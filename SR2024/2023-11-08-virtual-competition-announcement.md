Hello! 

We're happy to announce that in addition to our physical competition, we'll be holding a **virtual competition**. We'll run our virtual competition on our [robot simulator](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/).

The virtual competition is an opportunity for your teams to test their coding skills before the physical competition takes place.

The results will be broadcast live on **Saturday 9th March 2024 at 1pm GMT**  via a livestream on our YouTube channel.

The code submission deadline will be **2 days before**, that's Thursday 7th March 2024 at 6pm GMT.

During the competition, your robot will compete in (at least) 4 virtual matches for real league points, these points will then transfer across to the physical competition!

We have made an amendment to our rules to add further details.
