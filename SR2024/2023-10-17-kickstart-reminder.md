Hello there!

With [Kickstart][kickstart] this Saturday we wanted to let you know what to
expect on the day and how to get the best start on your robot.

As you already know, the event is fully remote. There are two main aspects to
the day:

- the presentation, which will be [livestreamed][livestream] on Youtube, and
- the microgames, a set of tasks to familiarise you with the kit (details on
  what you'll need below)

We encourage all teams to watch the livestream on the day and work through the
microgames together afterwards. If you are unable to do this for some reason the
presentation and microgames will continue to be available afterwards on the
[Kickstart event page][kickstart] and remain a great place for your team to
start working on their robot.

There will be two document links for the microgames -- one for the competitors
which outlines the challenges and another for you which has the answers.

What you'll need for the microgames:

- **your kit**; all the kits have been dispatched -- please let us know if yours
  hasn't arrived!

- at least one **computer** that can install and run the [simulator][simulator];
  we'd encourage installing the Webots software ahead of time, though note that
  you will need to download the simulation files afresh from our docs after the
  game has been announced at Kickstart.

- at least one **computer** which has a USB port, so you can get code onto your
  kit; it may be easier if this is the same computer that can run simulator

- at least one pair of **wire cutters** and **wire strippers**, for wiring up
  your robot kit

Having access to [Discord][discord] on the day will also be very useful -- we'll
have Blueshirts (our awesome volunteers!) available there throughout the day,
ready to answer any questions your team may have and to help them through the
microgames.

While your team will need access to hand tools once they begin building the
robot, you shouldn't need any for the microgames tasks.

Finally a reminder that throughout the year we're hosting a number of
[Tech Days][tech-day-signup], opportunities for teams to spend a whole day
working on their robot with lots of help available. There's just one space left
for the November Tech Day so [sign up soon][tech-day-signup] if you'd like to
attend.

If you have any questions, please let us know!
