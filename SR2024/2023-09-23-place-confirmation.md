You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2024!

As the new school year starts, so does Student Robotics. The year starts with a
"Kickstart" event which gives competitors and team supervisors an introduction
to this year's competition and overview of how to build and engineer their
robot.

At various points in the year we will have a number of "Tech Days" at locations
around the UK. These provide an opportunity for your team to get hands-on help
from our volunteer mentors, make progress on their robot and meet other teams.

Throughout the year your team will be able to get support for our mentors via
[Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/tutorials/discord). In addition to
shared channels where any team can ask questions, each team will have their own
private text chat channel and team supervisors can request voice & video
channels too. These offer a space for teams to discuss their robot and get
direct support from our mentors at any time. We will send out invites to Discord
separately.

This year **Kickstart is fully virtual**. We strongly encourage teams to meet up
to watch the presentations, get to know each other and start working together on
the kit. We will be shipping kits out to teams ahead of the event, so
_please ensure we have the correct shipping address_.

On the day we will be livestreaming an introduction to the competition, the game
and the kits. We will also be providing a set of tasks which will familiarise
competitors with the kit, which the teams can complete afterwards. There will be
mentors around in Discord throughout the day to support teams working through
these tasks.

To receive your kit we need a _secondary contact_ for your team. This should be
someone at your institution (e.g: head of department). They should know about
the competition, and be able to act as a backup contact.

Please fill in this form to confirm your shipping address and provide details of
your secondary contact:

We look forward to seeing you at Kickstart!
