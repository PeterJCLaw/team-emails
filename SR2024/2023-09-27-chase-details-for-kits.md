Hello,

We hope you're as excited about the start of the Student Robotics year as we
are!

As you're hopefully aware, the year starts with a virtual [Kickstart][kickstart]
event on Saturday 21st October which gives competitors and team supervisors an
introduction to this year's competition and overview of how to build and
engineer their robot.

Ahead of Kickstart we're planning to send out your loaned [robotics kit][kit-docs],
for your team to use as the core of your robot. As mentioned in our previous
email confirming your place, we need some details for you before we can do that.
So that your kit can arrive by Kickstart please complete the following by this
**Sunday 1st October**:

- A _secondary contact_ for your team. This should be someone at your
  institution (e.g: head of department). They should know about the
  competition, and be able to act as a backup contact.
- You need to agree to our _kit disclaimer_ (PDF attached). This disclaimer
  covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit and outlines
  the limits of our responsibilities. Please sign it, scan it and email it back
  to us.
- Confirmation of your _shipping address_.

Please fill in this form to confirm your shipping address and provide details of
your secondary contact:

To ensure that you receive your robotics kit before Kickstart, please provide
us with the details described above by Sunday 1st October.
