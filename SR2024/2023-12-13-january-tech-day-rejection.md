Hi $TODO_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME,

Unfortunately, we're unable to offer you a place for our January tech day in Horsham.

The venue is quite small and we received a very high number of applicants. We see you signed up for the Cambridge tech day in March; we'll do our best to ensure your place is confirmed there. Final confirmations will happen early February.

We recommend you still get together on January 20th, we'll ensure there are extra volunteers available to give you remote support over Discord.

Thanks, $TODO_VOLUNTEER_NAME
