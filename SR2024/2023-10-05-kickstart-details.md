Hello there!

We're pleased to announce further details for Kickstart and open signups for
Tech Days throughout SR2024.

## Kickstart

As you already know, [Kickstart][kickstart] is on Saturday 21st October and is
fully remote.

The presentation, which will be [livestreamed][livestream], will
start at 10am UK time and last for approximately an hour. This will explain this
yearâ€™s game, the competition structure, and give an overview of the kit.


| Time  | Info |
|-------|------|
| 10:00 | Introductory presentation, where the game of SR2024 will be announced. |
| 11:30 | Microgames, a set of tasks to familiarise you with the kit. |
| 12:30 | Lunch. |
| 13:30 | Microgames, continued. |
| 16:00 | Finish. |

Throughout the afternoon we'll have Blueshirts (our awesome volunteers!) in the [Discord server][discord], ready to answer any questions you may have and to help you through the microgames.
These microgames will help your team become familiar with the Kit you've been provided and should kickstart some ideas for your robot's design.

## Tech days

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

We're planning on running 4 tech days:

- [4th November in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/horsham-tech-day-november)
- [9th December in Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/southampton-tech-day-december)
- [20th January in Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/horsham-tech-day-january)
- [2nd March in Cambridge](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/cambridge-tech-day-march)

If you're interested in attending any of these events, please complete [this form][tech-day-signup]. Volunteers may also be around virtually on these days for support, should you not be able to attend any events in person.

For the November tech day, spaces are limited to four teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup]
by Friday 27th October 2023 if you'd like to attend. We will be allocating and
confirming places for it we receive applications, so sign up soon to avoid
disappointment.


If you have any other questions, please let us know!
