Hi,

With just over half of the competition year now complete we hope your robots are progressing well.

## Virtual Competition

The [Virtual Competition][virtual-competition] is the first stage of the SR2024 competition.

This is the first test of your team's coding skills, pushing their virtual robot
to the limit, competing against other teams in a virtual arena and offering
valuable experience in real matches. Points earned in the virtual league are
part of the main competition, so they could make all the difference at the
physical competition.

Your team must submit their code **two days before**, by 6pm GMT on Thursday 7th
March via the code submitter: <https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/>.
Your team can login using your three letter acronym ($TODO_TLA_HERE) as the
username and the password is the same as the password your team used to enter
Discord.

The matches will be broadcast live on **Saturday 9th March 2024 at 1pm GMT**
via a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlfaQIfLaRg) on our YouTube
channel.

## Mentoring

Mentoring support from one of our volunteers can be invaluable in terms of
helping understand the kit, rules and competition; in encouraging and pushing
your team; and as enthusiastic role models.

Where geographically possible we'll try to match your team with a mentor who can
attend your meetings in person. Alternatively we can mentor your team remotely
via video calls, as long as you or another supervisor are present in person.

If you would like a mentor for your team, please sign up at <https://forms.gle/V831FNHaMLC4h4pVA>.

## Challenges

In the lead-up to the second [Challenge deadline][second-challenge] this
Saturday (5pm GMT) be sure that your team gets their submissions in on time.

Do remember that if a submission is not judged to pass and you have the time to
do so, your team can attempt the challenge again in order to resolve any issues.

## Tech Days

[Tech Days][tech-day-101] are opportunities for your team to spend a whole day
working on their robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity
to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

If you would like to attend the [final Tech Day of the year][cambridge-tech-day],
on March 2nd in Cambridge, there's still time to [sign up][tech-day-signup].


Regards,

-- the Competition Team
