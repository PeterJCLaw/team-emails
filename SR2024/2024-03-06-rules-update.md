subject: Changes to the bonus point for leaving your planet
---

Hi,

We've released an update to the [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules) which changes how the bonus point works.

Game rule 18 states "There is a bonus point available for a robot fully leaving its home planet for the first time in a game.". Unfortunately, this could result in cases where teams ended up with fractional points, when combined with The Egg being on the teams' planet.

The rules have been updated to state that this point is applied **after** any penalties from The Egg. We hope this doesn't impact your robot or strategy too much.

If you or your team have any questions please do post them in the support section of Discord.
