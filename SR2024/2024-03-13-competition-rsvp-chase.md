Hi $TODO_NAME,

{% if attended_virtual_comp %}
It was great to see your team at the Virtual Competition this weekend.
{% else %}
We missed you at the Virtual Competition this weekend.
{% endif %}

I wanted to check on how you're doing and whether you wanted any extra help -- via Discord, in person or otherwise. There's still plenty of time to work on your robot before the competition!

We'd also like to finalise our planning for the competition, including things like assigning team pits at the venue -- for which we need to know a little about the competitors you'll be bringing.

**Please could you [fill out your team details](https://forms.gle/8YhfdRbfDWP3KKNy8) to let us know.**

Thanks,
Peter
