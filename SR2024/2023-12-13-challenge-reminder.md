Hi $TODO_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME,

Congratulations to the 15 teams that completed one of the challenges in time for the first submission deadline this past weekend. We've been really impressed with the challenge submissions this year, it's been great to see the creativity of so many teams so early on in the competition.

If you aren't aware of the challenges, you can find out more about them in the [rulebook](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/2024/rulebook.html#challenges)

Congratulations to the 15 teams that managed to complete a challenge by that deadline.

The next [challenge deadline](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/second-challenge-submission-deadline/) is 20th January 2024, so remember time will be short when your team gets back from Christmas break. There are another 5 league points up for grabs for anyone who manages to submit a challenge for this deadline.

Your team can re-submit if their first attempt didn't pass. If you have any questions, just ask us via e-mail or Discord.

We wish you and your team a Merry Christmas!

Thanks, $TODO_VOLUNTEER_NAME
