Hi $TODO_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME,

Just a reminder that the first challenge submission deadline passed over the weekend. 

If you aren't aware of the challenges, you can find out more about them in the rulebook [here](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/2024/rulebook.html#challenges)

Congratulations to the 15 teams that managed to complete a challenge by that deadline.

The next challenge deadline is 20th January 2024, so remember time will be short when your team gets back from Christmas break. There are another 5 league points up for grabs for anyone who manages to submit a challenge for this deadline.

Your team can re-submit if their first attempt didn't pass, if you have any questions, just ask us via e-mail or Discord.

We wish you and your team a Merry Christmas!

Thanks, $TODO_VOLUNTEER_NAME
