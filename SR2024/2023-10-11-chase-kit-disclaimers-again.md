Hello,

With [Kickstart][kickstart] just around the corner we'd really like to send you
your [kit][kit-docs].

Before we can do that we need you to agree to the _kit disclaimer_ (PDF attached).

This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit
and outlines the limits of our responsibilities. Please sign it, scan it and
email it back to us.

We can no longer guarantee that your kit arrives in time for Kickstart, so to
ensure that your team is not further delayed in starting to work on their robot
please do this  **as soon as possible**.
