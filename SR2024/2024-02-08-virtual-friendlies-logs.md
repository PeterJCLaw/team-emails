Hi!

Your team submitted some code for our virtual 'friendlies' matches, we ran the matches and have attached all the results in a zip file below!

In these friendlies, your robot ran against other teams' robots. We've attached the log file printed from your robot, alongside an .mp4 (video recording) file for each match in the 'animations/' subfolder.

Your robot was a different colour (starting in a different zone) each time, here are the details so you know which is you:

Team XXX:
- Match X: You are XXXXX (zone X)
- Match X: You are XXXXX (zone X)
- Match X: You are XXXXX (zone X)
- Match X: You are XXXXX (zone X)

Thanks!
