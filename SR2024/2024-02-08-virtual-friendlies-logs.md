Hi!

Your team submitted some code for our virtual 'friendlies' matches.

In these friendlies, your robot ran against other teams' robots. We're keeping it secret exactly *which teams* you ran against. We've attached the log file from your robot in a zip file below.

We've also shared this info on your team's discord channel.

Your robot was a different colour (starting in a different zone) each time, here are the match recordings, plus which robot you were in:

Team XXX:
Match X: You are XXXXX (zone X)
