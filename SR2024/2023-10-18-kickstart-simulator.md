Hello there!

Following from our previous email about the microgames, we're pleased to say
that we will be making a robot [simulator][simulator] available at Kickstart and
this will form part of the tasks in the microgames.

As in previous years the simulated world is hosted within the third party
[Webots][webots] software, which is a fairly large download (around 300MB).
To run robot code within the simulator you will also need to download and
install [Python][python] 3.11.

To save time on the day, you may wish to download and install these before
Kickstart.

If you have any questions, please let us know!
