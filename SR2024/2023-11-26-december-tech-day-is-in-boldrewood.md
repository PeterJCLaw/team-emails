Hi $TODO_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME,

Just a quick update about the December [Tech Day in Southampton][event-page].

We have now confirmed that this event will be taking place on the University's Boldrewood campus.

There will be parking available on campus -- once you arrive, ask one of our volunteers for a permit to leave in your vehicle.

We've updated the [event page][event-page] on our website with directions and further details.

We're looking forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks!

Thanks,
$TODO_VOLUNTEER_NAME
