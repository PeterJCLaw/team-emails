Hi all,

With the 2024 season of Student Robotics now complete, we'd love to hear about your experiences so we can make next year the best year yet!

Thanks to all those who have already submitted feedback, though if you haven't -- please do let us know your thoughts.

We're particularly keen to hear your perspective as a supervisor -- https://forms.gle/ttRNrnwQwqM1wJWZ6.

Additionally, if any of your competitors haven't yet done so and would like to they can fill in https://forms.gle/88TS3hrJbvbjS2rEA.

Your feedback is valuable in helping shape how we run the competition in the future, as well as in attracting sponsors.

Thanks,
Peter
