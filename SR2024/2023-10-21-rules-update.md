Hello there!

Just a quick update to let you know that we've issued a revision to the rules in
order to correct the orientation of the Spaceships in the arena diagram. The
initial revision had these facing towards the edge of the arena, when they will
in fact be facing towards the central asteroid field.

You can find the full rulebook on our website at: <https://srobo.org/rules>

If you have any questions, please let us know!
