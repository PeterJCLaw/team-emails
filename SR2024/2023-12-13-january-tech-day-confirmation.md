Hi $TODO_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME,

I'm pleased to confirm your place at the January 20th Tech Day in Horsham. 

The venue has a small car park to the rear which you are welcome to use. If you do plan to use this, please let us know the registration number of the vehicle so we can add it to their parking system.

There's an outline of the day on the event page on our website. Exactly what your team work on during the day is up to them -- we don't have any set schedule. Some teams use Tech Days as an opportunity to generally work on their robot, while others focus on a specific task they want to achieve or get help with.

As the second and final challenge submission deadline is the same day. If your team hasn't completed a challenge for this deadline yet, this is a really good opportunity to grab 5 league points.

Whatever your team is working on, we'll ensure we have volunteers around to help them make progress.

Thanks, $TODO_VOLUNTEER_NAME
