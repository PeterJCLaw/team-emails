Hi $TODO_CONTACT_GIVEN_NAME,

I'm pleased to confirm your place at the 9th December Tech Day in Southampton.

On the sign up form you indicated a need for parking. The university has various pay & display car parks, however these are usually free on weekends. Depending upon exactly which room we use at the university we may follow up to collect registration number of vehicles to offer you closer parking. We'll let you know if that's needed.

We look forward to seeing you in December!

Thanks,
$VOLUNTEER_NAME
