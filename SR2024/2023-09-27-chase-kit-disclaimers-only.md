Hello,

We hope you're as excited about the start of the Student Robotics year as we
are!

Ahead of Kickstart we'd planning to send out your loaned [robotics kit][kit-docs],
for your team to use as the core of your robot.

Thank you for submitting your secondary contact details and confirming your
shipping address.

As a reminder you also need to agree to our _kit disclaimer_ (PDF attached).
This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit
and outlines the limits of our responsibilities. Please sign it, scan it and
email it back to us by this **Sunday 1st October**.

If we do not receive a signed kit disclaimer by then we cannot guarantee that
your kit will arrive in time for Kickstart.
