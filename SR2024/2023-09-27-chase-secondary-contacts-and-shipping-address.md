Hello,

We hope you're as excited about the start of the Student Robotics year as we
are!

Ahead of Kickstart we're planning to send out your loaned [robotics kit][kit-docs],
for your team to use as the core of your robot.

Thank you for submitting your kit disclaimer, as a reminder please complete the
following by this **Sunday 1st October**:

- A _secondary contact_ for your team. This should be someone at your
  institution (e.g: head of department). They should know about the
  competition, and be able to act as a backup contact.
- Confirmation of your _shipping address_.

Please fill in this form to confirm your shipping address and provide details of
your secondary contact:

To ensure that you receive your robotics kit before Kickstart, please provide
us with the details described above by Sunday 1st October.
