Hi,

We're going to be running some friendly matches a couple of weekends before the
[Virtual Competition][virtual-competition]. We don't intend to livestream the
matches, however we will record them and make both the recordings and robot logs
available to your team afterwards.

The friendlies give teams an opportunity to test their code in the real
competition simulator environment, however these matches are completely optional
and will not contribute towards the main competition.

The deadline for code submissions will be by 6pm GMT on Thursday 22nd February.
