A history of communication with teams. Organised by event and date sent. If it's in `master`, it's been sent!

If an email contains links to forms, or other potentially sensitive information, leave the link out of the emails!

## How to send emails

Emails should be sent using the MailChimp account.

When sending emails to 'All Teams', please send to both the _"Website - Potential Team Leaders"_ and _"Potential Team Leaders"_ lists.
