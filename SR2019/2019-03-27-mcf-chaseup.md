Hello,

We notice we've not received any media consent forms from your team. 

Media consent forms must be signed to gain access to the venue. Having media consent forms signed and processed before the event greatly speeds up the reception process.

You can download the media consent form from [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/competition/). 

If you are unable to attend the event, please let us know. We hope to see you at the competition!
