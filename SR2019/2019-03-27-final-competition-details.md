Hi all,

The competition is now less than 2 weeks away! We have some additional important information for you.

Most importantly is media consent. Media consent forms must be sent to us by 5pm Thursday 4th April. After then most of our volunteers will be on site and not handling
forms. If you've not returned a media consent form by then, it will take significantly longer to pass through reception, and some competitors may be turned away.

You can download the media consent form from [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/competition/).

Parents and other visitors do not require tickets, but are required to sign media consent forms. These forms should be brought with them, or can be signed at reception.

Please ensure that your team bring at least 1 laptop or appropriate device with them to the competition to access the docs and IDE on. We are unable to provide any computing devices for competitor use at the competition. We will be providing a wireless internet connection to all teams.

Any tools that your team requires to modify their robot must be brought to the competition by the team: we cannot provide any. In particular, the use of any dangerous tools must be supervised by the responsible adult for the team.

All robots are subject to a safety check before the start of the competition (see appendix B in the rulebook). We may disqualifying any dangerous robots, so please ensure the team have checked their robot against the safety checklist.

You must bring all of the robotics kit (including the white RUB it came in) to the competition, so that we can collect it at the end of the event, unless you've already arranged to keep the kit longer.

If you have any questions, please let us know as soon as possible. We hope you and the team are looking forwards to the competition as much as we are, and may the best robot win!
