Hi all,

Just a reminder and some information on the tech day we're running on on Saturday 9th March.

Tech Days are opportunities for you to get help if you're struggling with a technical issue, and is a controlled environment to make more progress on your robots. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to see how well you're doing in comparison to other teams. This is the final tech day before the competition, and so is the last chance to get some hands-on help from us blue shirts.

We're running this tech day in 2 locations, London and Southampton. The day will run from 10am until 5pm, however feel free to come and go as you please. Please let us know if you're interested in attending. The London venue will only run of there is sufficient interest, and spaces are limited to six teams.
