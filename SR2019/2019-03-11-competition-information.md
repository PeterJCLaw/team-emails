Hi all,

There's just 26 days between now and the competition, and we're getting the final things ready for Student Robotics 2019. We hope your robots are competition-ready, and you're well on your way to entering a robot capable of winning!

We have some final information for you for the competition.

## Venue Layout

The team pits for this year's competition are spread over 3 floors. If any members of your team have reduced mobility, or any other specific requirements which may impact the location of your team pit, please let us know as soon as possible so we can account for this when placing teams.

## Media Consent Form and Tickets

As with previous years, we require you to sign a media consent form. These media consent forms allow us to use videos and photographs taken at the event for future marketing purposes.

[Download our Media Consent form]()

If a member of your team is under the age of 16, they will need to get a parent or guardian to sign on their behalf.

Once these forms have been completed, please send them to `teams@studentrobotics.org` with the word 'media-consent' in the subject line, to ensure they won't be missed. We will have media consent forms available at the event, but pre-processing them makes the reception process faster.

Once your form has been processed, you'll receive an automated email response with your ticket. These tickets must be bought with you to the competition (printed or on a phone is fine).

## Rules Update

We recently made our first update to the rules. This contained some important, but minor changes:

- Specify how we interpret whether a robot is in a zone
- Add a regulation allowing supporting equipment
- Clarify the wording of the scoring zones grid
- Change the documented hashtag from `#srobo2019` to `#srobo19` to follow what was being used internally

The rules have been updated in the [docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/).

## Emergency contact information

Some teams have asked for emergency contact information on our forums (https://studentrobotics.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=46&p=201#p201). We have a dedicated contact number for use at the event. This number should only be used by team leaders and college staff.

Contact number: <number>

This number should only be used for this competition event and will only be answered on the day before and the during the event.

## Support

With less than 4 weeks left until the final, we hope you're progressing well. The time left to get support is growing smaller, so if you're facing any issues, be sure to check the rules and the docs, they usually hold the answers! If you have any questions, please let us know on the forums, we try to answer them as quickly as possible.

We've also updated our website with more information on the venue and parking. We will keep updating this with more information, so be sure to keep an eye on it.

We look forward to seeing you at the competition. Good luck!
