Hello,

We're assembling some volunteers who are able to go to your school to help out with mentoring.

Mentors are volunteers who have typically competed or helped out with the competition before. They're able to give help on all aspects of building and programming your robot, and if they don't know something, they typically know someone who does.

If you'd like a mentor to visit your team either regularly or as a one-off to help them out with building their robot, fill out this sign-up form:

[Sign up to get a mentor][mentor-signup]

We typically have more teams interested than we have free volunteers, so we sadly can't guarantee every team gets a mentor.
