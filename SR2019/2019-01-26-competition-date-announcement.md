Hello all,

As some eagle-eyed members of your team may have noticed on [the forum](https://studentrobotics.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=35), today's the day we confirm the dates for Student Robotics 2019!

The competition will be held from *Saturday 6th April* until *Sunday 7th April*. The competition will be held at the University of Southampton's Highfield campus, so please plan accommodation / transport accordingly. The exact start/end times are to be confirmed, but doors open 9am, and we aim to finish around 5pm.

## Tech Days

There are just two remaining tech days between now and the competition. These are a great chance to spend a full day testing on your kit, and get direct support from us. The remaining tech days are:

- 9th February
- 9th March

Information for these tech days are available on [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/).

## Media Consent
Media consent will be required to attend the competition. The forms for this will be sent through in the next week or two. These will need to be signed by each member of your team, as well as staff. Those under 18 will need a parent / guardian to sign on their behalf.
