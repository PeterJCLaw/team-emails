Hi

You can now submit your robot code through our website for the [virtual competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/virtual-competition/).

[Submit your robot](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).

You have until 8pm (UK) Friday 24th February to submit your team's latest code. You can upload early, but at that time we'll capture all the uploads. If you fail to upload any code, you will be marked as absent from all the matches and score 0 points. This will not affect your ability to compete in the [final competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/).

Simply log in with your TLA (You can find this from your channel name in Discord, removing `team-`, in upper-case) and the password for your team's Discord channel we sent at the start of the competition year. If you need a refresher, please let us know. Once in, you can upload a `.zip` of your code (Make sure your `.zip` contains a file named `robot.py`).

As there is just 1 chance to submit, we have a few suggestions for things to keep an eye out for:

- Remember to use `r.zone` - as your robot could start in any of the 4 corners, not just corner 0.
- Make sure you're using [available libraries](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/python/libraries#simulator).
- Make sure to use [`R.sleep`](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/programming/#simulated-time) rather than `time.sleep`.
- Try running your simulation in ["competition mode"](https://github.com/srobo/competition-simulator/tree/main#competition-mode), in case there are any discrepancies.

As a bonus, if a version of your code is uploaded by _this_ Friday at 8pm, we will run the matches for you in a competition setting, and let you kno of any issues with your code, before the actual submission deadline!

You can see your team's previous uploads on that same page.

Good luck!
