Hello,

That's a wrap on the virtual competition! Congratulations to all teams who entered, we saw some great performances and very interesting matches. If you were unable to catch the event live, you can find it on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTJGOhwmLPo).

The current state of our league table can be found [on our website](https://studentrobotics.org/comp/league). This is up-to-date with all the points earned in the virtual competition, as well as those from the challenges.

{% if attended %}

The logs from your virtual matches have been posted in your teams' Discord channels. If you'd like them emailed instead, just let us know.

It's a shame we didn't see your team at the competition, but we hope your physical robot is progressing well. Not entering will put you at a disadvantage to the teams that did enter our virtual event. If you'd like some extra support, please reach out either by email or on Discord.

If you no longer wish to, or are unable to compete in Student Robotics 2023, please let us know as soon as possible.
