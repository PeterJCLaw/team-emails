Hello,

We will be hosting a [Virtual Tech Day on the 3rd December][virtual-tech-day] in
our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help your team out by having guaranteed presence from
us blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give
kit support, and assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in
the competition.

A voice channel will be created shortly before the event starts, where you and
your competitors can join and chat with us. We have a few group activities
planned which will take place here. Note that your team may only speak in the
voice channel if either you, or another parent / guardian is around.

We look forward to seeing you all then!

-- the Competition Team
