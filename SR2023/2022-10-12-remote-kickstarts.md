Hi,

Unfortunately we have not been able to confirm a venue for Kickstart in London,
however we are hoping to organise a Tech Day in London in November. We apologise
for the lack of communication in this regard, and we do appreciate the
challenges of arranging events at such short notice.

You are still very welcome to come to Southampton on Saturday 22nd October or to
attend remotely. We will be [livestreaming][livestream] the introductory
presentation and our volunteer mentors will be around in Discord during the day
to support teams getting started.

In either case details on how to receive your kit will be coming through soon.

We look forward to seeing you on the day!
