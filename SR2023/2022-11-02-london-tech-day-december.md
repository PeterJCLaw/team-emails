Hello,

We're pleased to announce that we'll be hosting an [in-person Tech Day][event]
on 2nd December in London.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us
blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit
support, and assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in
the competition.

Spaces are limited to six teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup] if
you would like to attend. We will be confirming places shortly after you sign up.

At the very latest please signup by Wednesday 30th November 2022, though we may
close signups sooner if all places are filled.

We look forward to seeing you then.
