Hello!

## Competition venue

We're thrilled to announce the venue for Student Robotics 2023!

The competition will be held from *Saturday 1st April* until *Sunday 2nd April*, at the University of Southampton, so please plan accommodation / transport accordingly. The exact start/end times are to be confirmed, but doors open 9am, and we aim to finish around 5pm.

If you have any special requirements, or require any extra documentation from us, please get in touch.

We will put more details on [the event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/) as they become available.

## Tech Days

We also have some upcoming Tech Days - an opportunity for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

Our next tech day is on Saturday 4th Feb, both virtually and in [Horsham](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/horsham-tech-day-february/). Spaces are limited in Horsham, but there are still spots available, so act fast.

With the deadline for the [second and final challenge submission](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/second-challenge-submission-deadline/) on the same day, this Tech Day provides an excellent opportunity for your team to work towards completing the challenges and earn more early league points.

All events can be found on our website: https://studentrobotics.org/events/

## Simulator

We've also just released a new version of the simulator: `2023.2`. This includes the following changes:

- widens and raises the robot grabber so that it can pick up gold tokens; this also changes some of the sensors to account for the possible gold token in the front of the robot:
   - the camera is now higher up, tilted slightly downwards and has a wider field of view
   - the front ultrasounds sensors are moved forward slightly
- adds `Robot.is_simulated()` to detect that code is running in the simulator

This release can be found [on the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/).

If you have any questions, please do let us know, either by email or in Discord.

Thanks,
-- SR Competition Team
