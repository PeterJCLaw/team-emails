Hello!

We hope your team is working hard on their robot in preparation for virtual competition in just under two weeks!

To assist you, we've released an update to the robot simulation. Please ensure you're developing your robots on the latest version of the simulator, as that'll be the version we'll be running at the virtual competition.

As always, you can download the latest version from [our simulator documentation page](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/).

Here's a list of what we have changed since the last version:
- Some pressure-sensing 'fingers' have been added to the end of the robot, you can deploy these fingers to lift the robot up and use the robot's arduino to measure the total pressure. This is to make it easier to differentiate between heavier and lighter tokens.
- We've tweaked the weight of all tokens to be lighter by 100g, to bring them closer to the weight of tokens in the physical competition.
