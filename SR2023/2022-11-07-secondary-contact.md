Hi,

We're in the process of sending out kits to teams, however we don't have a
valid secondary contact for your team.

Please provide a second set of contact details for someone at your institution
(e.g: head of department). They should know about the competition, and can be
used as a backup contact. It should be an individual, rather than a generic
school office number.

- Name
- Email
- Phone number


Secondary contacts are important for us in the event of an emergency. Once we
have this information, we can get your kit dispatched to you.

Thanks,
