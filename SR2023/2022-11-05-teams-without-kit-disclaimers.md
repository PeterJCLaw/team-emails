subject: Getting your kit

Hi,

We're in the process of sending out kits to teams, however as you have not yet
submitted a kit disclaimer form we aren't able to send yours.

This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit
and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.

Are you likely to be able to submit a signed disclaimer by 11th November?
Otherwise we may offer your place to another team.

As it's a legal document, please print out and sign the disclaimer form
attached then scan it and email it back to us.

Please reply to this email to confirm which address we should send the kit to.

If you have any other questions or still wish to compete but will be unable to
submit a disclaimer soon, please let us know and we can work something out.

-- the Competition Team
