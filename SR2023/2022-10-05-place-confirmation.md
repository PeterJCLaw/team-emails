You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2023!

At Kickstart we'll run through the competition, the kit, and of course this year's game. Kickstart will be held in Southampton on Saturday 22nd October. We are still trying to confirm details for a possible London venue and aim to update you on that by the end of the week. Sadly, we are unable to run a kickstart event in Cambridge this year.

{% if southampton %}
We're looking forward to seeing you at the [Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/southampton-kickstart/) Kickstart.

If you are not able to attend, please let us know so that we can arrange alternative way to get you your kit.
{% else %}
If you are able, and we are unable to find a London venue, you're still welcome to attend the Southampton Kickstart. Please let us know your plans for attending, or if you can no longer attend in person, so we can arrange getting you a kit.
{% endif %}

For those of you who cannot attend Kickstart, we are planning to livestream it - links will be available shortly before the event on the [event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/southampton-kickstart/).

In either case details on how to receive your kit will be coming through soon.

We look forward to seeing you there!
