You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2023!

At kickstart we'll run through the competition, the kit, and of course this year's game. While the details for kickstart are not yet available, the events will provisionally be on the 22nd October in London and Southampton. We'll let you know as soon as those are available.

For those of you who cannot attend kickstart, we are planning to livestream it - links will be available shortly before the event on the [event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/kickstart/). Details on how to receive your kit will be coming through soon too.

We look forward to seeing you there!
