You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2023!

At kickstart we'll run through the competition, the kit, and of course this year's game. Kickstart will be held in Southampton and London on Saturday 22nd October.

{% if requested southampton %}
We're expecting you at the [Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/southampton-kickstart/) kickstart.
{% if requested london %}
We're expecting you at the [London](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/london-kickstart/) kickstart.
{% if southampton or london %}
In the original sign-up, you requested a place at either the [Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/southampton-kickstart/) or [London](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/london-kickstart/). Please let us know which kickstart you'd like to attend so we can ensure there's a kit ready for you.
{% if only cambridge %}
Sadly, we are unable to run a kickstart event in Cambridge. If you are able, you're still welcome to attend either [London](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/london-kickstart/) or [Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/southampton-kickstart/). Please let us know which venue you'd like to attend, or if you can no longer attend in person.
{% endif %}

For those of you who cannot attend kickstart, we are planning to livestream it - links will be available shortly before the event on the [event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/kickstart/). Details on how to receive your kit will be coming through soon too.

We look forward to seeing you there!
