subject: Changes to the size of tokens and markers
---

Hi,

We've released an update to the [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules)
which changes the sizes of token markers and of the Bronze & Silver tokens.

The markers are now 80mm (down from 100mm) and the Bronze & Silver tokens are
130 Â±10mm (up from 110mm).

We realise that some teams may have started building their robots and we
apologise for the impact this may have on your designs.

The changes are being made as the sizes as originally specified would have
resulted in markers which were actually bigger than the tokens to which they
were being attached. This is due to the marker sizes being specified in terms of
the central black area of the marker, yet the surrounding white border being
necessary for the vision system to correctly identify the markers.

We will be releasing a kit update in the next few weeks which will accommodate
the change in marker size and will contact you again when that happens. At that
point we will also update the markers in the docs with the new size so that you
can print fresh token markers at the proper size. The distance and position
information returned by the kits is not expected to change significantly as long
as the new (smaller) markers are used only with the updated kit software and
vice-versa.

If you or your team have any questions please do post them in the support section of Discord.
