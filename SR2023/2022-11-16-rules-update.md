subject: Changes to the size of tokens and markers
---

Hi,

We've released an update to the [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules)
which changes the sizes of the Bronze & Silver tokens. We realise that some
teams may have started building their robots and we apologise for the impact
this may have on your designs.

The changes are being made as the sizes as originally specified would have
resulted in markers which were actually bigger than the tokens to which they
were being attached. This is due to the marker sizes being specified in terms of
the central black area of the marker, yet the surrounding white border being
necessary for the vision system to correctly identify the markers.

The new sizes are detailed in the revisions section of the document.
If you or your team have any questions please do post them in the support section of Discord.
