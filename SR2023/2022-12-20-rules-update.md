subject: "Rules update: Bronze token masses"

Hi,

We're pleased to announce that we've published an update to the rules which
specifies the mass of the Bronze tokens. Their mass is specified as 80 Â±40g.
The mass of Gold tokens remains unspecified.

Hopefully this will allow teams to progress on mechanisms to detect the
difference between the various token types.
