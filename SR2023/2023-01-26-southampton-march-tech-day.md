Hello,

We're pleased to announce that we'll be hosting an [in-person Tech Day][event]
on March 11th at the University of Southampton. Full details can be found on the
[event page][event].

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us
blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit
support, and assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in
the competition.

Please signup by Friday 3rd March 2023, though we may close signups sooner if
all places are filled. We will be confirming places shortly after you sign up.

We look forward to seeing you then.
