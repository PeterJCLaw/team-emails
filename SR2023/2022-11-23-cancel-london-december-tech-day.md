Hi,

Due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control we are no longer able to run
the London Tech Day planned for 3rd December.

We're really sorry about this and are disappointed that we aren't able to offer
this Tech Day.

Instead we are planning to run a [Virtual Tech Day][virtual-tech-day] in
[Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) on the same day,
so that teams who are able to work in another location are still able to get
support to progress their robots.

A voice channel will be created shortly before the event starts, where you and
your competitors can join and chat with us. We have a few group activities
planned which will take place here. Note that your team may only speak in the
voice channel if either you, or another parent / guardian is around.

We hope to see you all then.

-- the Competition Team
