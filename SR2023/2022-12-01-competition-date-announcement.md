Hey everyone!

Today we're happy to confirm the date for the Student Robotics 2023 competition!

The competition will be held from *Saturday 1st April* until *Sunday 2nd April*. Unfortunately we're not ready to announce the location just yet, though we're working hard to get this confirmed as soon as possible. But, we hope announcing the date will give you the opportunity to pen it into your calendars and get the ball rolling on the paperwork.

Our schedule for the day is also yet to be confirmed, though we normally run 9am to 5pm on both Saturday and Sunday.

We will keep you posted and put more details on [the event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/) as they become available.
