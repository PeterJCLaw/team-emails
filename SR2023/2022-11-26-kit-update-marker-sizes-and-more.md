---

Hi,

We've released version [2023.1.0 of SR OS][sr-os-update], the software which
runs on the brain board. This includes a number of changes to the vision system,
including the update for the recent marker (and token) size change.

As you are hopefully already aware, markers are now 80mm (down from 100mm) and
the Bronze & Silver tokens are 130 Â±10mm (up from 110mm).

Along with this change we have also released new versions of the
[marker PDFs][markers-pdfs] for use in developing your robots.

Once again we apologise for this change and recognise that it may impact robots
that you had already started building.

As we noted previously, the distance and position information for these smaller
markers should be essentially unchanged versus the larger ones, as long as the
new kit software is used exclusively with the new markers (and vice-versa).

This update also includes tooling to understand what your code is doing
("interactive debugging"), improvements to how often the vision system detects
markers and much more. For details of these changes and how to apply it to your
kits please see our latest [blog post][blog-post].

If you or your team have any questions please do post them in the support
section of Discord.
