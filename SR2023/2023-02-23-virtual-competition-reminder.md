Hi

We're really looking forward to see your robots in the [virtual competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/virtual-competition/) this weekend.

[Submit your robot code](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/) by 8pm on Friday.

If you're having any issues logging in to the code submitter please let us know as soon as possible. You can log in to the code submitter using your TLA and the same password as you use for Discord.

You have until 8pm (UK time) Friday 24th February to submit your team's latest code. You can upload early, but at that time we'll capture all the uploads. These matches are your first 4 appearances in the competition, scoring you valuable league points. It's also a great way to see how you robot's strategy fares against other robots. Not entering will put you at a disadvantage to the teams that have entered our virtual event.

You won't be able to re-submit between matches in the virtual competition, so it's important your code is as well-tested and reliable as possible come the submission deadline. Because of this, we have a few suggestions for things to keep in mind:

- Remember to use [`R.zone`](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/#OtherRobotAttributes) - as your robot could start in any of the four corners, not just corner 0.
- Make sure you're using only [available libraries](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/python/libraries#simulator).
- Make sure to use [`R.sleep`](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/programming/#simulated-time) rather than `time.sleep`.
- Try running your simulation in ["competition mode"](https://github.com/srobo/competition-simulator#competition-mode), in case there are any discrepancies.
- You can use [`R.is_simulated`](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/#OtherRobotAttributes) to determine whether your code is running in the simulator or not.
- If you have a question or are stuck on something, ask a blueshirt!

You can see your team's previous uploads on that same page.

Additionally, we have a [Tech Day in Southampton on 11th March](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/southampton-tech-day-march/). This will be the final tech day before [the competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/competition/). If you're interested in attending, please [let us know](https://forms.gle/oJ9DK8imzek7fQQb6) by Friday 3rd March.

Good luck!
