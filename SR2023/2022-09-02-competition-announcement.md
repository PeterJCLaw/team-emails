Hi,

We're pleased to announce that registration for Student Robotics 2023 is now
open. If you would like to compete, please complete this [form][signup-form]
with the details of your team. All future emails about SR2023 will be sent there.

This year we're planning to host multiple Kickstart events, all on the same weekend
in mid-late October. We will share more details about Kickstart as they
become available and we expect to confirm places at the end of September, so
sign up now!

  [I'm interested in bringing a team to SR2023][signup-form]

We look forward to seeing your teams,

Regards,

-- SR Competition Committee
