Hello!

Thank you for your interest in Student Robotics 2023. We would like to offer you a place. In order to do that, we have a few questions and extra pieces of information we need.

1. Can you confirm you are over the age of 18, and officially related to the institution you are bringing a team from (eg teacher at a school, leader at a scout group etc).
2. A contact phone number. We will only contact you by phone for urgent things, please ensure it is a number that you would have with you at events
3. Could you provide a second set of contact details for someone at your institution (eg head of department). They should know about the competition, and can be used as a backup contact.
   1. Name
   2. Email address
   3. Contact phone number
4. Are you able to attend a physical competition in the UK in early April?

Once we have these details, we can confirm your place, and then you're in!

While the details for kickstart are not yet available, the events are expected to take place on the same weekend in late October. We'll let you know as soon as those are available.

Thanks,

-- SR Competition Team
