Hello!

Thank you for your interest in Student Robotics 2023.

Before we can confirm your place, we have a few questions and extra pieces of information we need.

1. Can you confirm you are over the age of 18, and officially related to the institution you are bringing a team from (eg teacher at a school, leader at a scout group etc).
2. Could you provide a second set of contact details for someone at your institution. They should know about the competition, and can be used as a backup contact.
   1. Name
   2. Email address
3. Are you able to attend a physical competition in the UK in early April?

Once we have these details, we can confirm your place, and then you're in!

We're in the process of finalising kickstart details, and we'll let you know as soon as those are available.

Thanks,

-- SR Competition Team
