Hello!

Thank you for your interest in Student Robotics 2023. We would like to offer you a place. In order to do that, we have a few questions and extra pieces of information we need.

Please complete the following short form: https://forms.gle/TDhCmRpvhJHR4gWP9

Once we have these details, we can confirm your place, and then you're in! We will also send you a disclaimer form for the use of our kits. These will need to be signed and returned before we can give you your robot's kit.

While the details for kickstart are not yet available, the events will provisionally be on the 22nd October in London and Southampton. We'll let you know as soon as those are available.

Thanks,

-- SR Competition Team
