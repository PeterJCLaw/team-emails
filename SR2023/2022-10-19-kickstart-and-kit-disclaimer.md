Hello there!

## Kits

We need to organize getting you your kit. Before this can happen, we need you to
sign a disclaimer. This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions under which
you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.

As it's a legal document, please print out and sign the disclaimer form
attached. If you're coming to Kickstart please bring it with you on the day and
we'll also have spare copies printed out. Otherwise please scan it and email it
back to us.

For those not coming to Kickstart we will send out your kit to the address
listed below. Please let us know explicitly if this address is correct, and if
it's not, let us know an updated one.

Address:

We will need this by the 5th November otherwise your place may be allocated to
another team. If this is going to be unachievable please let us know and we can
work something out.

## Kickstart

As you already know, [Kickstart][kickstart] is this Saturday 19th October. For
those attending in person please arrive at 9:45am at [Building 46][B46] on
Highfield Campus.

The presentation, which will be [livestreamed][livestream] from there, will
start at 10am UK time and last for approximately an hour. This will explain this
yearâ€™s game, the competition structure, and give an overview of the kit.

The rest of the day will provide an opportunity for your teams to get started on
your robots. For those in person these will focus on your kits while for those
attending remotely these will be based in the [Webots simulator][simulator].

Throughout the day there will be mentors available in [Discord][discord] to help
your teams getting started, so if your team haven't yet joined the server please
do encourage them to do so.


If you have any other questions, please let us know!
