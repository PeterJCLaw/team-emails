Hello!

I'm afraid Student Robotics 2023 is full, and we are unable to offer you a place. We've had more schools interested than we have places for.

If we have any early drop outs, we will be sure to let you know.

We hope you follow the competition on social media, and subscribe to our mailing list to be the first to know when places open for Student Robotics 2024.

Thanks again for your interest, and we hope to see you next year.

Thanks,
-- SR Competition Team
