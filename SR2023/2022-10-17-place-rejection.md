Hello!

We had a lot more interest in Student Robotics 2023 than we had places available. This has meant that unfortunately we're unable to offer you a place. Apologies for not contacting you sooner about this.

We realise this is disappointing (we're disappointed too!), however we are limited by the number of kits we have and by the size of the venue. We are always looking for ways to support more teams and hope to be able to do so in future.

If we have any early drop outs, we will be sure to let you know but we cannot promise anything.

We hope you follow the competition on social media, and subscribe to our mailing list to be the first to know when places open for Student Robotics 2024.

Thanks again for your interest, and we hope to see you next year.

Thanks,
-- SR Competition Team
