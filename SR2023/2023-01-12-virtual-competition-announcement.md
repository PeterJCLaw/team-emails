Hello,

We're pleased to announce the date for the SR2023 Virtual competition! Whilst you'll be competing in a virtual arena, you'll be competing for real league points, which could make all the difference in the final competition.

The Virtual Competition will be happening on **25th February 2023** at 1pm GMT. The event will be streamed live on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTJGOhwmLPo).

Before the virtual competition, we'll be sending you a link to our code submitter, where you can send your code to us. Your code must be uploaded before 8pm on Friday 24th.

All information can be found [on our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2023/virtual-competition/).

We look forward to seeing you then.
