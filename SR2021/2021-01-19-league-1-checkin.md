Hello there!

We noticed at least one of your teams was absent from our first league session last weekend. We wanted to reach out to see if there was any more support we could provide you, or questions we could answer?

## Resources

If you're struggling with your robot, here's a few resources which might help you out:

- [The Docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/)
- [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord), to get help from other teams / blue shirts

## Mentors

Alternatively, In order to help you get the most out of your robot, we'd like to offer some
hands-on support from one of our volunteers.

Your mentor will help guide your team towards good solutions for their robot, provide assistance where they might need it as well as help them understand the kit, the rules and the competition as a whole.

Mentors are volunteers who have typically competed or helped out with the competition before. They’re able to give help on all aspects of programming your robot, and if they don’t know something, they typically know someone who does.

If your team has a regular meeting time, please reply to this email to let us
know when this is and what platform you're using (it's fine if you're not using
Discord). We'll use this to match you up with a volunteer who'll be around when
you are. For safeguarding reasons, either you or another responsible adult such
as a parent / guardian will need to be around for any video or voice calls.

If your team doesn't have a regular meeting time feel free to ask in Discord
when you are meeting -- there's often a number of our volunteers online able to help.

## Tips

We've found that teams which have a regular meeting schedule to work on their
robot tend to do better, so you may find it useful to have a set time each week
that your team meets to catch up and review their progress.

Similarly, we've found that it is beneficial for the whole team to have a shared
understanding of the whole of the robot. This both ensures that every member of
the team is able to contribute as well as avoiding issues if one team member is
not available. This year we would encourage that you have a shared location for
the robot code and that everyone feels able to contribute to its development.

## Unable to continue?

If you no longer wish to, or are unable to compete in Student Robotics 2021, please let us know as soon as possible.

If there is anything further we can do, please let us know. We hope to see you in the [next league session](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-2/) on the 6th Feb.
