Hello there!

There are less than 2 weeks until our [first round of league matches](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-1/) so we wanted to check in and give you an update.

## League Sessions

The first league session will be happening on the 16th of January, at 12:00 UK time, lasting around 1.5 hours. You will need to have submitted your code to us (more on that below) by 08:00 UK time on the same day. If you do not submit code, or submit late, you will be marked absent and score 0 points.

Further details, and a link to the livestream, will be on our website soon - for this and the other league sessions.

## Simulator Update

We released a new version of the simulator, which adds a few important improvements:

- Support for Webots 2021a (no more deprecation warnings).
- Add several scientific libraries. See [the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/python/libraries) for a full list.
- Reconstructed arena to fix issues with distance sensors and shadows. **Note**: the new arena is _slightly different_ now, mostly that the interior (diagonal) walls have moved by a few centimetres.
- The error message about rate-limited LEDs now includes the ruggeduino pin number for the LED, rather than its name.

This can be downloaded from [the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/#installing-the-simulation). We recommend updating and testing your code with this version as soon as possible. Both the first league session and friendlies will use this version.

## Friendlies

As noted in our previous email, we're going to be running some friendly matches on the 9th of January. These matches are entirely optional, and will not contribute to the league. The matches are simply a chance to see how your robot performs against other robots, as well as socialise with other teams and us volunteers.

We'll use a YouTube [livestream](https://youtu.be/iwa-7R6sR8M) to broadcast the matches and as usual we'll provide your logs afterwards. Unlike our other events, these matches will be incredibly relaxed and informal. We encourage anyone to join in the conversation in Discord or in the chat.

If you are interested in entering our friendly matches, please let us know by either responding to this email, or in `#friendly-matches` on Discord.

## Code Submission

Because the competition is virtual this year, you'll need to send your code to us to run using our code submission tool.

In the next few days, you'll receive login credentials for this submitter, one set for each team. Here you'll be able to submit your code for us to run. The code should be in a zip file, and the entry point for your robot program named `robot.py`.

[Code Submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).

Please note that the latest submission will be used, which includes those for previous sessions.

## Discord

It's amazing to see how interactive teams are being on Discord, both within teams and with the rest of the competitor community. If you're not already in our Discord, please do join. Your join details were sent in a previous email.

We've noticed there are a few people in the Discord which don't fall into our regular definitions of "Competitor" and ["Team Leader"](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/user_accounts#team-leaders). Team leaders are the adults responsible for the team (if you're reading this email, that's probably you), and competitors are those actively competing and developing the robot.

For those who don't fit this, whether they be other staff members providing support for the team or ex-students providing experiences, we've created the "Team Support" role. If there are members of your team who fit this role, please let us know. This will allow them to better help teams and communicate with us.

If possible, please keep the people in discord in sync with those actively participating and contributing to your team(s) robot.

If you need help with any of these items, just let us know and we'll do our best to help! We hope you had a wonderful Christmas and new year, and look forward to the start of 2021.

Thanks,

SR Competition Team
