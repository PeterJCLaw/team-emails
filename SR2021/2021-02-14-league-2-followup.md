Hi,

It was great to see your robot at the second league session. We hope you found
it as exciting as we did and are looking forward to the new challenges which
module â…¢ brings. The full rulebook and simulator updates are available on our
website, so do check them out if you haven't already!

We just wanted to check on how you're doing and whether there's any more help
you need?

As a reminder, there's usually lots of volunteers around in Discord to help out
if you need anything, whether it's help programming your robot, organising your
team or you just need a fresh pair of eyes on something. Our volunteers have a
wealth of experience from both competing in Student Robotics and helping lots of
teams, so there's a good chance they can help :)

We also have a limited number of volunteers who would be able to regularly
mentor your team. This would provide you some more hands-on support in the form
of a volunteer who is able to be around whenever you regularly meet and would
get to know your team and your robot. Whatever platform you use (whether it's
Discord or something else), they'd be able to join your meetings to help you
out. (For safeguarding reasons we need you or another adult responsible for the
team to also be in any video calls).

If you're interested in having a regular mentor please just reply to this
email, letting us know when you meet and what platform you use.

Finally, we'd like to confirm the details for the friendlies ahead of the next
round of league matches. The friendlies will be streamed from noon (UK time) on
Saturday 13th March with code submission at 8pm on Friday 12th. If you'd like to
take part please send us a message in [#friendly-matches][friendly-matches].
We'd love to see lots of teams there as it's a great opportunity to find and fix
any last minute bugs before the league session.

P.S: We've found that teams who meet regularly tend to do better, so if your
team doesn't have a regular meeting time you might find it helps to set one up.
