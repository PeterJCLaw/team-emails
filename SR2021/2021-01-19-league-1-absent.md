Hello there!

We noticed at least one of your teams was absent from our first league session last weekend. We wanted to reach out to see if there was any more support we could provide you, or questions we could answer?

## Resources

If you're struggling with your robot, here's a few resources which might help you out:

- [The Docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/)
- [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord), to get help from other teams / blue shirts

## Mentors

Alternatively, if you'd prefer some more hands-on support, we may be able to allocate you a mentor.

Your mentor will help guide your team towards good solutions for their robot, provide assistance where they might need it as well as help them understand the kit, the rules and the competition as a whole.

Mentors are volunteers who have typically competed or helped out with the competition before. They’re able to give help on all aspects of programming your robot, and if they don’t know something, they typically know someone who does.

If you're interested in getting a mentor, please reply to this email to let us know when works best for you. For safeguarding reasons, either you or another responsible adult such as a parent / guardian will need to be around for any video calls.

## Unable to continue?

If you no longer wish to, or are unable to compete in Student Robotics 2021, please let us know as soon as possible.

If there is anything further we can do, please let us know. We hope to see you in the [next league session](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-2/) on the 6th Feb.
