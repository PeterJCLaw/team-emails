Hi,

Now that the league stage is over, we wanted to give you some quick reminders
about the schedule for next weekend's knockouts. We'd also love to hear about
about your experiences competing in SR2021.

## Feedback & Demographics Survey

To help us understand how we're doing we'd really like to understand the make up
of your team and their experiences with the competition this year. If they
haven't done so already please encourage your competitors to complete our
[feedback survey][feedback-survey] before the knockouts. These feedback forms are vital
both in securing funding, and ensuring we're always improving our events so competitors
get the most out of them they possibly can.

## Code Submission Deadline

The deadline for [code submission][code-submitter] for the knockouts is 8pm BST
(UK time) on Friday the 30th April. If your team is going to have any difficulty
uploading your code by this time let us know before the deadline and we'll try
to sort something out.

*Note*: if you don't submit code for the knockouts we'll use the code you
submitted for league 4. Of course we're expecting that many teams will want to
improve their code between the league and the knockouts and then resubmit,
that's completely fine.

*Tip*: do check that you have tried running the code archive you're going to
upload by running a competition match using it. There are instructions for the
`run-comp-match` script within the README of the simulator.

## Knockouts Details

The [live stream][knockouts-stream] will kick off at noon BST for around a
couple of hours of matches as well as the announcement of the award winners.

If you're curious about who you'll be facing, see our website for the
[knockouts schedule][knockouts-schedule].

We hope you've enjoyed this competition year as much as we have enjoyed watching
your robots progress and we look forward to seeing your robots this weekend.
