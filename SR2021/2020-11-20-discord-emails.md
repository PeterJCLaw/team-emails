Hi

As previously mentioned we're using [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) as our pirmary communication method for competitor support. Your invite link is [discord link].

Upon joiing the server users will need to provide a password to gain the correct permissions. Your team(s) details are

| TLA | Password |
| --- | -------- |
| ABC | Test     |

Please share both the invite link and the relevant password with your competitors.

If you have multiple teams but haven't split your competitors into these teams yet please ask them to use the first password and then we can change their roles when the teams have formed.

If competitors change teams or need their roles tweaked for whatever reason please ask them to ask for help in the #role-requests channel.

To get the 'Team Leader' role on Discord please reply to this email with your Discord username once you have joined the server and we will add the appropriate roles.
