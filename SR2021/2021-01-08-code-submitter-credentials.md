Hi,

Here are your credentials for using the [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/), the tool we're using to allow you to submit your code to us for running in a competition event.

The code should be in a zip file, and the entry point for your robot program named `robot.py`. Note what anyone in your team can submit code to the submitter, but only the latest upload will be used.

## Friendlies

If you're interested in competing in the friendlies this weekend you must let us know beforehand via email or discord, so we know to schedule you some matches. Teams who submit code but haven't signed up won't be entered. These matches are entirely optional, and will not contribute to the league. The matches are simply a chance to see how your robot performs against other robots, as well as socialise with other teams and us volunteers.

If you have any other questions, please let us know. We look forward to seeing you all at our [first league session](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-1/) in just over 1 weeks time!
