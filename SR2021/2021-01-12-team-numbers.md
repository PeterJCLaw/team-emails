Hi,

If you're reading this email, it means you have at least 1 team from your institution who seem inactive on Discord, or who have few members.

If you have teams requiring further guidance and support, the Discord is the best place to get support. Filled with knowledgable volunteers, competitors and team leaders, all trying to help.

If you no longer wish to have as many teams as you registered for, please let us know. Dropping out a team and merging it with an existing one becomes more unfair the further into the competition we get.

If we are worrying unnecessarily, please let us know to put our minds at ease!

We look forward to seeing you all at our [first league session](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-1/) this weekend!
