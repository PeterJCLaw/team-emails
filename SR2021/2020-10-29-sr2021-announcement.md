Hello there!

I'm pleased to announce sign-ups are now open for Student Robotics 2021.

## Competition

Unfortunately, we are unable to run a physical competition in a safe way. Instead, we will be running a virtual competition in a simulated environment. The competition year will be very similar to what you're used to. In a few weeks, we'll kick off the competition with a kickstart, which will culminate in a final competition 1st May.

However, on top of this we will be running monthly league sessions. These league sessions will be similar to those run for the virtual competition, and much like the regular competition league will seed your position in the final knockout.

## Kickstart

Due to current restrictions, kickstart will be streamed live on **21st November 2020**. Here we'll announce the game for this year, go into further details on how the competition year will work, and of course answer any questions you have.

Visit our website for more information.
