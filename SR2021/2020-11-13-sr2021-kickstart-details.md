Hello there!

We're pleased to announce some more details for the Student Robotics 2020 kickstart.

As you know, following on from the success of our [previous virtual competition](https://studentrobotics.org/news/2020-07-25-post-competition/), we will be running the competition in a simulated environment this year.

## Kickstart

Kickstart will be streamed live on **21st November 2020 at 13:00 (UK Time)**, aiming to finish around 16:00. Here we'll announce the game for this year, go into further details on how the competition year will work, and of course answer any questions you have.

If you've signed up for the competition, you'll soon receive an invite to our Discord server for your team. The invite link will be valid for `n` competitors, and should not be shared to those outside your team. If your institution has requested multiple teams, you'll receive multiple login links. We recommend sending these invites before kickstart to ensure they can get started straight away. Whilst most of the discussions and support will be happening here, if you are unable to or do not wish to create an account with Discord, you can still [contact us](mailto:teams@studentrobotics.org) for support.

The simulator will be based in [webots](https://cyberbotics.com/#download). The download is large, and we recommend downloading it before the event to ensure you can get started immediately. Information on downloading our simulation will be made available on [the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/competition-simulator/) during the event.

During the event, we recommend setting up a call for you and your team to communicate and collaborate, both to share ideas and discuss potential questions. After the main presentation we'll move into microgames, which are designed to help you et familiar with the simulator and robot. If you'd like a blue-shirt to sit in on this call to support competitors and answer any further questions, please [let us know](mailto:teams@studentrobotics.org). Note that for safeguarding reasons, we may only be in the call whilst you are.
