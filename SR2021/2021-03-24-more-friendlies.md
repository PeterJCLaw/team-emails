Hello there!

We're going to be running some friendly matches on a couple of weekends before
the next league matches:

- Saturday 3rd March [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prQD_tset20)
- Saturday 17th March [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O6BXPF6chY)

Both will be livestreamed on YouTube at 12:00 BST, with [code submission][submission]
by 8pm BST on the Friday evening beforehand.

If you're interested in competing you must let us know beforehand via email or
discord, so we know to schedule you some matches. Teams who submit code but
haven't signed up won't be entered.

These matches are entirely optional, and will not contribute to the league. As
usual we'll provide your logs afterwards. These matches will be incredibly
relaxed and informal and, as ever, we encourage anyone to join in the
conversation in Discord or in the chat.

If you have any other questions, please let us know. Otherwise, we look forward
to seeing you all at our [final league session][league-4] in a month's time!
