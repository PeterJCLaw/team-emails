Hey team $TEAM, just wanted to check on how you're doing?

As a reminder, there's usually lots of volunteers around in Discord to help out
if you need anything, whether it's help programming your robot, organising your
team or you just need a fresh pair of eyes on something. Our volunteers have a
wealth of experience from both competing in Student Robotics and helping lots of
teams, so there's a good chance they can help :)

P.S: We've found that teams who meet regularly tend to do better, so if your
team doesn't have a regular meeting time you might find it helps to set one up.
