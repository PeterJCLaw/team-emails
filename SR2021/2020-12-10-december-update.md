Hello there!

There are only 5 weeks until our [first round of league matches](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-1/) so we wanted to check in and give you an update.

## Progress

We've put together the below checklist of things that we hope will have happened by now to ensure you're making good progress.

 - Team Leaders should be in Discord and have the "Team Leader" role
 - Competitors should be in Discord
 - (If multiple teams) Competitors have formed separate teams and have the correct team role in Discord
 - Microgames from Kickstart should be completed
 - You should have a robot that moves, with some intelligence
 - Everyone in the team should have access to the team's code and can collaborate
 - Everyone in the team should have run the code and understands how it works

## Friendlies

Some of the competitors in Discord have expressed an interest in us running friendly matches. We think this is a great idea, so on the 9th of January we will be running non-scored matches for any team that wishes to take part. More information around how to submit code and opt in to the matches will follow!


If you need help with any of these items, just let us know and we'll do our best to help!

Thanks,

SR Competition Team
