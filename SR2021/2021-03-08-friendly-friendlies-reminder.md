Hello there!

Just a reminder that we're running some friendly matches this weekend (Saturday 13th March) at 12:00 GMT. If you're interested in competing you must let us know beforehand via email or discord, so we know to schedule you some matches. Teams who submit code but haven't signed up won't be entered.

Code should be [submitted](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/) by 8pm GMT on Friday 12th.

These matches are entirely optional, and will not contribute to the league. We'll use a YouTube [livestream](https://youtu.be/UFSzS0otFpQ) to broadcast the matches and as usual we'll provide your logs afterwards. These matches will be incredibly relaxed and informal and, as ever, we encourage anyone to join in the conversation in Discord or in the chat.

If you have any other questions, please let us know. We look forward to seeing you all at our [third league session](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-3/) in just over 1 weeks time!
