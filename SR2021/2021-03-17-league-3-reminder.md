Hi,

With the third round of league matches coming up this weekend, we wanted to
give you some quick reminders about the schedule.

## Code Submission

Please [submit your code][code-submitter] by 8pm GMT on Friday. If your team is
going to have any difficulty uploading your code by this time let us know before
the deadline and we'll try to sort something out.

*Tip*: do check that you have tried running the code archive you're going to
upload by running a competition match using it. There are instructions for the
`run-comp-match` script within the README of the simulator.

## League Matches

As before we'll be kicking off our [live stream][live-stream] at noon GMT for a
couple of hours of matches.

## Module â…£

Following the league matches we'll be announcing the rules for the fourth module
of the game, along with the updates to the simulator.


We look forward to seeing your robots this weekend.
