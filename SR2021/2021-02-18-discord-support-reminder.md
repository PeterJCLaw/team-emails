Hey team $TEAM, just wanted to check on how you're doing?

As a reminder, there's usually lots of volunteers around in Discord to help out
if you need anything, whether it's help programming your robot, organising your
team or you just need a fresh pair of eyes on something. Our volunteers have a
wealth of experience from both competing in Student Robotics and helping lots of
teams, so there's a good chance they can help :)

We'd also like to offer you some more hands-on support in the form of a regular
mentor. This would be a volunteer who is able to be around whenever you
regularly meet and would get to know your team and your robot. Whatever platform
you use (whether it's Discord or something else), they'd be able to join your
meetings to help you out. (For safeguarding reasons we need your team leader to
also be in any video calls; your team leader will have details about this).

If you're interested in having a regular mentor please @me in reply to this
message, letting me know when you meet and what platform you use.

P.S: We've found that teams who meet regularly tend to do better, so if your
team doesn't have a regular meeting time you might find it helps to set one up.
