Hi All,

Just a quick update on the current state of affairs with Student Robotics.

## Student Robotics 2021

Due to recent events, and the current measures in place, we will not be running a **physical** competition for Student Robotics 2021.

This does not mean there will be no competition! We are currently actively planning what Student Robotics 2021 will look like, and hope to have an update for you soon. Our current intention is that it would start around mid-late November.

## Kits

If you are still in possession of a kit, please keep hold of it for the time being. If you are unable or unwilling to keep hold of your kit, please let us know as soon as possible.

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
