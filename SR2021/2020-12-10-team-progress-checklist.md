Hello there!

There are only 5 weeks until our [first round of league matches](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/league-1/) so we wanted to check in and make sure you're making good progress! We've put together the below checklist of things that should have happened by now to help you figure out if you're on track for success.

 - Team Leader should be in Discord
 - Team should be in Dsicord
 - (If multiple teams) Competitors have formed seperate teams and have the correct team role in Discord
 - Microgames from Kickstart completed
 - You have a robot that moves
 - Everyone in the team has access to the team's code
 - Everyone in the team has run the code

If you haven't completed any of these items just let us know and we'll do our best to help out!

Thanks,

SR Competiton Team
