Hi,

As you surely know by now, [the competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2024/competition/) will be on Saturday 13th April and Sunday 14th April at the University of Southampton.

We're working hard getting the event ready for you. In order for us to cement our plans, we need to know roughly how large your team is and whether there are any special considerations we need to take for anyone who is coming.

We understand you might not know the exact number of team members who will attend, so vague guesses are absolutely fine for now! You'll be able to edit your response until our plans are cemented. If you still want to make changes after that, please send us an email and we'll see what we can do.

[Fill out your team details here](https://forms.gle/8YhfdRbfDWP3KKNy8)

Thanks,
-- SR Competition Team
