Hi,

You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2025!

Thank you for taking on the role of a [team supervisor][team-supervisor] for
your team. If you have any questions about the [competition programme][programme-structure],
building a robot or anything else, please feel free to reach out to us in the
`#team-supervisors` channel on [Discord][discord] or email us at
<teams@studentrobotics.org>.

This year we're hosting [Kickstart][kickstart] at the University of Southampton,
on Saturday 12th October. We will also be live-streaming the event if you are
unable to attend in person. In that case we encourage that your team meet up to
watch the presentations, get to know each other and start working together on
the kit.

As usual we will loan your team a [kit][kit] of parts to help build your robot.
This year we hope to send out kits shortly before Kickstart, in early October.

In order to enable us to send out your kit you need to agree to our _kit
disclaimer_ (PDF attached). This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions
under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.
Please **sign it, scan it and email it back to us**.

We will be sending your kit to the shipping address you provided when you signed
up:

    SHIPPING_ADDRESS

We will send you an email with a tracking link once your kit is on its way.

If your team would like to get started before Kickstart, **new for this year**
we have prepared some [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities] which
introduce robotics and our simulator without needing the kit.

At various points in the year we will have a number of "[Tech Days][tech-days]"
at locations around the UK. These provide an opportunity for your team to get
hands-on help from our volunteer mentors, make progress on their robot, and meet
other teams.

Throughout the year your team will be able to get support for our mentors via
[Discord][discord]. In addition to shared channels where any team can ask
questions, each team will have their own private text chat channel and team
supervisors can request voice & video channels too. These offer a space for
teams to discuss their robot and get direct support from our mentors at any
time.

We'll send out more information about this year's [Discord][discord] server
along with an invite link in the coming weeks.

We look forward to seeing you at Kickstart!
