Hi,

We're pleased to [announce][announcement] that registration for Student Robotics
2025 is now open. If you would like to compete, please complete the
[signup form][signup-form] with the details of your team. All future emails
about SR2025 will be sent to the details you provide there.

This year we're hosting [Kickstart][kickstart] at the University of Southampton,
on Saturday 12th October. We will also be live-streaming the event for those
unable to attend in person. We expect to confirm places towards the latter half
of September. Places are limited, so sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

As usual we will loan competing teams a [kit][kit] of parts to help build their
robots. This year we hope to send out kits before Kickstart.

Also **new for this year** we have prepared some [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities]
to enable teams to start learning about robotics and our simulator right away.

  [I'm interested in bringing a team to SR2025][signup-form]

We look forward to seeing your teams,

Regards,

-- SR Competition Committee
