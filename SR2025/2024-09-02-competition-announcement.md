Hi,

We're pleased to [announce][announcement] that registration for Student Robotics
2025 is now open. The [programme][programme-structure] will run from October
this year until around Easter 2025.

If you would like to compete, please complete the [signup form][signup-form]
with the details of your team. Entries must be made by a responsible adult on
behalf of a team -- we call this role a [team supervisor][team-supervisor]. All
future emails about SR2025 will be sent to the details you provide via the form.

This year we're hosting [Kickstart][kickstart] at the University of Southampton,
on Saturday 12th October. We will also be live-streaming the event for those
unable to attend in person. We expect to confirm places towards the latter half
of September. Places are limited, so sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

As usual we will loan competing teams a [kit][kit] of parts to help build their
robots. This year we hope to send out kits before Kickstart.

Also **new for this year** we have prepared some [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities]
to enable teams to start learning about robotics and our simulator right away.

  [Sign up to SR2025][signup-form]

We look forward to seeing your teams,

Regards,

-- SR Competition Committee
