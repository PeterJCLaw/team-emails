Hi {team-supervisor-name},

We haven't heard from your team in a while and wanted to check how you're doing?

If you're struggling with your robot, or if you're just keeping your strategy
secret (we promise we won't tell anyone) we'd love to know how we can best
support your team.

We're in the process of planning for the competition and will soon need to know
how many competitors you will be bringing.

Could you please give a quick status update on how you're doing?

Thanks,
-- the Competition Team
