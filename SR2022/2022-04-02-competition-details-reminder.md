Hello all!

It's only 2 weeks until the big day - [the competition](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/)!

Before then, we have a few important updates and reminders for you:

## Robot design considerations

At the competition, all robots undergo a safety check. This not only confirms that the robot satisfies our safety regulations, but also the rules. Of note are a particular few we often see teams forgetting until the last minute:

- Please make sure the power button is obvious and easily accessible. In the event of an issue in the arena, we don't want to be hunting for the switch as we try and quickly turn off your robot.
- Ensure your battery is protected, ideally housed in its own rigid container.
- Make sure you have a way to mount the flag. We will have a few spare mounts, but please do not rely on this. [Plastic push-fit couplers](https://www.screwfix.com/p/jg-speedfit-plastic-push-fit-equal-tees-15mm-5-pack/74470) work well for this.
- Make sure your robot fits inside the size constraints. If it doesn't, it will have a meeting with the _saw of shame_.
- Make sure there are 2 spare USB ports: 1 for your code, and 1 for our "Competition USB". This Competition USB tells your robot that it's in the competition and which corner it's starting in (and thus populates the `R.zone` property). You will not be able to compete without this.

All of these and more can be found in our [safety regulations](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/safety-regulations) and [rules](https://studentrobotics.org/rules).

## Media consent

Before gaining access to the venue, everyone will need to sign a media consent form. These media consent forms allow us to use videos and photographs taken at the event for future marketing purposes.

[Download our Media Consent form](https://studentrobotics.org/resources/sr2022/media-consent.pdf)

Please bring these forms with you to the competition. Unlike in previous years, these forms do not need to be emailed in ahead of time. We will have spares at reception, but bringing completed forms will allow you, your competitors, and guests to proceed through faster.

## COVID Safety

Life is beginning to get back to normal, and this means we are finally able to do in person events again! However, we must recognise that some people still have to be cautious, to protect their own health or their friends or family. As such, we ask that everyone follows [our COVID policy](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/) to help ensure we all keep safe, whilst still having lots of fun with robots!

Please keep an eye on this as we get closer to the competition, as the content may change.

## Southampton Marathon

On Sunday 24th April, a marathon event is being held in Southampton. As a result there will be a number of road closures in the area, including on the university campus. Parking will also be limited. Keep an eye on the [competition page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/) on our website to see up-to-date information on how to reach the competition.

Please note that this also means that access to food sellers may be restricted, so please plan accordingly.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

We look forward to seeing you all at the competition!
