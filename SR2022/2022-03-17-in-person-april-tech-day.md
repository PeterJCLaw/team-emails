Hello,

We're pleased to announce that we'll be hosting an [in-person Tech Day][event]
on 2nd April. We've got one venue confirmed and are exploring whether we have
capacity for others.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They’re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us
blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit
support, and assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in
the competition.

Spaces are limited at this Tech Day, so if you’d like to attend please
**[sign up for the Tech Day][signup]** by Friday 25th February 2022.

We look forward to seeing you all then.
