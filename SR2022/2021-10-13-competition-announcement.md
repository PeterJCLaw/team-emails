Hello Team Leaders,

Just a quick update from us on our plans for Student Robotics 2022.

First, we are now taking sign-ups for SR2022, click below to sign up:

[Sign up to Student Robotics 2022](https://forms.gle/LINK_CENSORED)

Once you sign up, we'll confirm your place as soon as we can. We'll keep you updated, and you can keep an eye on [our website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/kickstart/) for more details too. Here are our current plans for the year ahead:

* Although the simulator-based activities worked well last year, this year we’re excited to give students a chance at building fully autonomous physical robots again.
* Our kickstart this year will be virtual and live-streamed on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/studentrobotics), which will happen on November 13th.
* We intend to run a physical competition in a venue in the UK roughly around April, with teams attending with their robots.
* We'd also like to return to sending mentors to teams where we're able, and remote support when we can't.
* We're looking at how we can widen our impact in the schools and groups we work with in addition to our main competition. Our line of thinking at the moment is developing an activity that can be run over a half or full day with an entire class or year group. We're still at a preliminary stage with this but may want to trial something in this school year. We'd really welcome some help as this is developed, please get in touch if you feel this would be beneficial, or would like to discuss this further.
* Non UK based teams (i.e. if you'd have special COVID related requirements to attend an event in the UK), please get in touch with us separately - especially if you still have kit and would like to use it this year - we'll try and figure out a sensible way forward.

Thanks again for your continued efforts and improvisation - we're all really looking forward to seeing you and your teams in person again and to what this year's competition will bring! If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to send us an email!

Regards,

-- SR Competition Committee
