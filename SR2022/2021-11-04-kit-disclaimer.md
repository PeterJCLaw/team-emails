Hello there!

We now need to organize shipping you your kit. Before this can happen, we need you to sign a disclaimer. This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.

As it's a legal document, please print out and sign the disclaimer form attached, and email it back to us. Once we have a release form for you, we'll send out your kit to the address listed below. Please let us know explicitly if this address is correct, and if it's not, let us know an updated one.

Address:

If this form is returned and signed correctly by first thing on the morning of Tuesday 9th, your kit will be with you the Monday after [Kickstart](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/kickstart/) (15th).

If you have any other questions, please let us know!
