Hi

This year, we're using [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) as our primary communication method for competitor support. Your invite link is [discord link](). If you don't already have a Discord account, you can register an account for free.

Upon joining the server users will need to provide a password to gain the correct permissions. For your team, the password is: `password`. Please share both the invite link and the relevant password with your competitors. Discord access should not be shared to those outside your team.

If competitors change teams or need their roles tweaked for whatever reason please ask them to ask for help in the [#role-requests](https://discord.com/channels/900501415548579842/900501416269971460) channel.

More information on this can be found in [the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord).

Additionally, we like to make sure we are aware which members are blueshirts, competitors and team supervisors. To get the 'Team Supervisor' role on Discord please reply to this email with your Discord username once you have joined the server and we will add the appropriate roles.

Whilst most of the discussions and support will be happening on Discord, if you are unable to or do not wish to create an account with Discord you can still [contact us](mailto:teams@studentrobotics.org) for support, however the response times will be longer.
