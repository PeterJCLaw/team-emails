Hello,

With the competition now underway, we’re planning the ways we can help your
teams build the best robots they can. We can support you through our Tech Days or individual mentoring.

## Mentoring

During the competition year we aim to provide support to teams in many different ways. If you would like one of our volunteers to visit your team meetings on a regular basis, either in person or by video chat, please [sign up for mentoring](https://forms.gle/qqwQkdCfVBSum4w79).

Your mentor will help guide your team towards good solutions for their robot, provide assistance where they might need it as well as help them understand the kit, the rules and the competition as a whole.

If we have volunteers who are able to attend your regular meeting times, we'll let you know.

## Tech Days

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They’re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in the competition.

### December Tech Day

The first of these Tech Days will be held on **4th December** in our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server. The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit support, assist with the microgames, and assist with your strategy ideas.

If you are interested in some more direct mentoring on this day, please respond to this email. We can then set up a voice channel for your team in Discord, which can be used both by your team and us mentoring. Note that we may only be in the voice channel if either you, or another parent / guardian is around.

If you have any suggestions of what would be most useful for us to mention or support you on, please also let us know.

### Future Tech Days

In the new year, we are hoping to be able to run some in-person Tech Days, allowing some more hands-on mentoring.

To most efficiently organize and run these, we need to know where would be best to run these events. Please fill in the below form to let us know the locations you would be interested in. We can't confirm dates or schedules yet, but with this information we hope to get some out early January.

We hope to see you all at a future Tech Day!
