Hello,

We will be hosting a [virtual Tech Day on the 22nd January][event-link] in our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server. It will be much more involved and interactive than the previous one.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit support, and assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in the competition.

A voice channel will be created shortly before the event starts, where you and your competitors can join and chat with us. We have a few group activities planned which will take place here.

For mentoring, it will be easiest for us to continue doing this through Discord. If you are interested, we can then set up a voice channel for your team, which can be used both by your team and us mentoring. Note that we may only be in the voice channel if either you, or another parent / guardian is around.

More information is available [on our website][event-link].

If you have any suggestions of what would be most useful for us to mention, questions you'd like us to cover or support you on, please also let us know.

We look forward to seeing you all then.
