Hi all!

The team pits for this year's competition are spread over 2 floors. If any members of your team have reduced mobility, or any other specific requirements which may impact the location of your team pit, please let us by 25th March so we can account for this when placing teams.

With less than 6 weeks left until the final, we hope you're progressing well. The time left to get support is growing smaller, so if you're facing any issues, be sure to check the rules and the docs, they usually hold the answers! If you have any questions, please let us know on Discord, we try to answer them as quickly as possible.

We look forward to seeing you at the competition. Good luck!
