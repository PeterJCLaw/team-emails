Hi all,

We'd like to thank you for taking part in Student Robotics 2022 and making it such a successful event! It was fantastic to finally see robots in-person again after two years of being virtual. An article about the competition, results, and game has been [posted on our website](https://studentrobotics.org/blog/2022-05-03-sr2022-hrs-wins-sr2022/).

Congratulations again to our winners:

## Feedback

We'd love to get feedback on how the competition was for your competitors this year, so we know what we did well, and where we can improve. Please share the below short, anonymous survey with your competitors.

[Send us feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQXNw6XnATZM2LaBORIt_TgRqed3hNxpd2_2vdXXNxLY8ubA/viewform)

Additionally, we welcome feedback from you the supervisors too. Please fill in this survey.

Without all of your invaluable feedback we wouldn't be able to run the competition and attract new sponsors.

## Outstanding kit

Whilst most of you will have returned your kit at the end of the competition event, you may still have the other pieces of Student Robotics kit around your college. If you were unable to attend the competition, this will likely be a full kit.

If you do still have some of our kit, please let us know as soon as possible so we can organise its safe return. It is vitally important that all kit is returned to us so we can clean, test and re-issue it for future competitions.

We will be contacting you soon if our records indicate you still have some items of kit.

## Future Events

We hope to run a competition next year and see you all there. We plan to open places around September and will let you know as soon as they are.

In the meantime, be sure to follow us on Twitter [@StudentRobotics](https://twitter.com/studentrobotics) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/student_robotics).

### Volunteering

Student Robotics is powered by a collection of passionate individuals with varying skills from diverse backgrounds, many of whom are former competitors. We're all volunteers who give our spare time to make these events possible. If you have students graduating this year who may be interested in volunteering, please ask them to sign up to be a blueshirt at [srobo.org/join](https://srobo.org/join).
