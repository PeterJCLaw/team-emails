You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2022!

As you will have seen, [kickstart](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/kickstart/) will be virtual this year, streamed live on YouTube. At kickstart we'll run through the competition, the kit, and of course this year's game.

To those of you who don't have kit yet - don't worry! Details on how to receive your kit will be coming through soon.

We look forward to seeing you there!
