Hi teams,

Only a couple of days left until Saturday’s Kickstart event, so here are some more details on what to expect and what we need from you.

## Kits

If you don’t already have a kit, we will have contacted you regarding the delivery arrangements. We need you to sign the kit disclaimer form we sent you in a previous email before we can ship it to you, these forms must be signed and returned to us as soon as possible to ensure your kit arrives on time.

If you have a kit from a previous year, we will soon be sending you instructions on how to update the software and check that everything is present and correct. You may also need to upgrade your kit software after you recieve it, we'll keep you posted.

## Kickstart

As you already know, [Kickstart](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/kickstart/) is at 1pm UK time this Saturday 13th November. The livestream will last for approximately an hour and we will explain this year’s game, the competition structure, and give an overview of the kit.

As we are not running a Kickstart in a centralised location, we have prepared an activity as a kick-off session for your team to learn their robotics kit. We'll be sending it out to you immediately after Kickstart, but we can also optionally provide virtual/physical support. If you’re interested, please [sign up here](https://forms.gle/ojysPbkfcpKCtW8z6).

If you're more confident, or if we're unable to offer you individual mentoring, we will still be hosting a virtual tech day later this year where volunteers will be available to answer any questions you may have about the kit, rules and competition structure.

## Discord

We’ll shortly be sending out the login details for Discord, where your team can collaborate and ask questions for our volunteers. Once you’ve received the details, you'll need to [sign your team up to our Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord).

See you on Saturday!
