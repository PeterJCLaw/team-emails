Hello,

As you know, we are hosting a [virtual Tech Day on the 22nd January][event-link] in our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server. It will be much more involved and interactive than the previous one.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us blueshirts.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in the competition.

Then plan for the day will be:

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 10:00 | Introductory presentation, going through the plan for the day, reminding about the competition
| 10:20 | Mentoring from volunteers - working on your robot with a skilled selection of volunteers on hand to mentor. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit support, and assist with your strategy ideas.
| 13:00 | "Common pitfalls" presentation
| 13:30 | More mentoring
| 14:30 | Lightning talks - a chance to show off your robot, code, strategy and team so far
| 14:45 | Competition Q&A - a chance to ask any questions you or your team may have about the competition, rules and their robot.
| ~15:00 | Close

A voice channel will be created shortly before the event starts, where you and your competitors can join and chat with us. We have a few group activities planned which will take place here. Please note that your competitors will be unable to communicate with the rest of the call unless you or another responsible adult is present.

For mentoring, it will be easiest for us to continue doing this through Discord. If you are interested, we can then set up a voice channel for your team, which can be used both by your team and us mentoring. Note that we may only be in the voice channel if either you, or another parent / guardian is around.

More information is available [on our website][event-link].

If you have any suggestions of what would be most useful for us to mention, questions you'd like us to cover or support you on, please also let us know.

As a reminder, we are intending to run an in-person competition for SR2022. This is of course dependent on the government guidelines which we are keeping a close eye on. More information on this can be found on our [COVID-19 page](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/).

We look forward to seeing you all at the tech day!
