subject: March Virtual Tech Day Reminder

Hello,

As a reminder, we will be hosting a [virtual Tech Day on the 5th March][event-link]
in our [Discord][sr-discord] server.

Tech Days are great opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on
their robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how
other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

The aim of this day is to help you out by having guaranteed presence from us
blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit
support and assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams to attend Tech Days and performance in
the competition.

A voice channel will be created shortly before the event starts, where you and
your competitors can join and chat with us. **Please note that your competitors
will be unable to communicate with the rest of the call unless you or another
responsible adult is present.**

For mentoring, it will be easiest for us to continue doing this through Discord.
If you are interested, we can then set up a voice channel for your team, which
can be used both by your team and us mentoring. Note that we may only be in the
voice channel if either you, or another parent / guardian is around.

More information is available [on our website][event-link].

If you have any specific things you'd like help with at the Tech Day please do
let us know. We're also always able to help if you ping us in [Discord][sr-discord]
or email us at any time.

We look forward to seeing you all then.
